cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview,17143,lfyzh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfyzh5/cramer_is_working_hard_to_take_down_videos_of_his/,670,1612892354.0,"plenty of you degenerates have seen the interview from 2006 where jim cramer talks about about stock manipulation being a ""fun game"" from his hedge fund days. he goes as far as saying the sec isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail. it's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics. what does that tell you about how wide-spread this is in the industry? now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today.

all the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by the street.

""what's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. and, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down.""

everyone have a good hard think about this. this guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the sec and every retail investor in the stock market. he's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we see people like deepfuckingvalue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.

i met jim cramer over a decade ago. can confirm he is a prick.

edit: here is a transcript of first 2 minutes 40 seconds of the interview if you can't watch the video (in comments). it goes on for another 8 but this should be enough for your ape attention spans:

**a:** welcome to wallstreet confidential, i'm aaron tass(?), joined again by jim cramer. jim, welcome

**cramer:** good to see ya.

**a:** thanks for being here. uh, so, economic data out today but wanna talk about something else first. again today we have the misdirection from the futures. the futures pointing up in market. as of right now it's actually down again. is this just because it's the holiday period that we're seeing this?

**cramer:** you know, a lot of times when i was short at my hedge fund, and i was position short, meaning i needed it down, i would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures. it doesn't take much money. similarly, or if i were long and wanted to make things a little bit rosy, i would go and take a bunch of stocks and make sure they were higher. maybe commit 5 million in capital to do it and i could effect it. what you're seeing now is probably a bigger market, maybe you need 10 million to knock the stuff down. but it's a fun game, and it's a lucrative game. you can move it up and then fade it, that often creates a very negative feel. so let's say you take a longer term view intra-day and you say listen, i'm gonna boost the futures and when the real sellers comes in i'm gonna knock it down and it's gonna create a negative view. that's a strategy very worth doing. when you're valuing on a day to day basis. i would encourage anyone who's in a hedge fund to do it, because it's legal. and it uh, is a very quick way to make money. and very satisfying. and by the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that but i don't care. and i can't - i'm not gonna say it on tv.

**a:** there's so many more hedge funds today than when you were managing yours. do you think that exacerbates the moves or makes it tougher?

**cramer:** well, you know, the hedge funds are positioned long-short. they're not just long like mutual funds. so it's really vital these next 6 days cuz of your pay day, you really gotta control the market. you can't let it lift. when you've got research in motion(?) it's really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that down because it's the fulcrum of the market today. so let's say i were short, what i would do is i would hit a lot of guys with rim, now you can't foment. that's a violation of, of..

**a:** ferment? (lol)

**cramer:** yeah, you can't foment. you can't create, yourself, an impression that a stock's down. but you do it anyway because the sec doesn't understand it. so, i mean that's the only sense i would say this is illegal. but a hedge fund not up a lot really has to do a lot to save itself. so, this is different from what i was talking about in the beginning where i'd be buying the q's and stuff. this is actually just blatantly illegal. but when you have 6 days and your company may be in doubt because you're down, i think it's really important to foment if i were one of these guys.

stuff for new traders (no gme discussion),3163,lfxux0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxux0/stuff_for_new_traders_no_gme_discussion/,322,1612887066.0,"i gotta say, i see some good shit out there. i see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. this is the path my fellow retards. i'm a nobody here, but i have good returns and some good insight. when i came to wsb, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck i was doing, because i knew jack shit. i care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. so let me pass on a couple things. i can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

i mainly trade options (calls and puts), so that is what i will discuss

generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an etf or index. while riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. so decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. while what i said is true, i am usually against putting everything into a single bet. anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. the goal of this game is to stay alive. you will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. so never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. this goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have some cash ready to go. you never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

paper hands and diamond hands are just words. you ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. one of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so you decide when it's time. having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

here's a couple psychological principles in investing. studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. they let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. think about this before you sell. stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. this is why it's important to know why you got into a position. trust your dd and stick to the plan. i had ideas for plays where they went red right away and i bailed... only to see them moon. ""diamond hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. the hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. i'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. your call though.

the market makers and big boys want you to lose. they want your money. i'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka buy high and sell low. they know fomo is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. we're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. however, we still have negative days. stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. do you know what the big money did? they bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. we've been mooning ever since.

sometimes shit makes no sense. a company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. i was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the earth that day. it was total bullshit and i knew it, i trusted my dd. so instead of panic selling, i added to my position. sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. this is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. it's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

option expiration dates matter. buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. however, it can often be a noob trap. one bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. stocks trade sideways sometimes. sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. and sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. so give yourself time to work with. time costs money and hurts profit margins. but it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. look, playing weekly stupidly otm calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. i do at least one or more every week. the key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. remember, no tendies = no more fun.

along the same lines, strike price matters. an otm (out of the money) option means that the strike price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. otm options give huge profit margins the further you go out. i personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. but my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. if your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. itm (in the money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. itm is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

leaps are fuckin dope. a leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. i'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. a lot of people buy itm leaps, but again, i'm a degenerate and go otm a lot.

implied volatility (iv) - extremely fucking important. iv is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. high iv = expensive options. it's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low iv stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. low iv is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. high iv is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. buying an option on a stock right before earnings report (er) will be more expensive due to iv. trying to play er is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good dd about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. one of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into er. the company will deliver great news and then dump hard. you may see people bitching about this very soon. basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

buy the rumor and sell the news. events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. you will get shit on. ask someone about tesla battery day. positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

finally, get busy learning. read about options on investopedia and any other things you do not understand. the big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. learn about the general market. stocks are grouped into ""sectors"" or categories. start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. i didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. the first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""greeks"" are. that will teach you how options function.

if anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. i'm a degenerate with no life.

oh and, if you follow someone's dd and lose money that's on you. i've come up with some genius shit, but i've also lost on some retarded calls. nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

the second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. there were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. on the way home that night, i taught him everything i learned from books i'd read about the different bets. ""smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

the next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. it seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. at the end of the night, i had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. i handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. when i finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. he had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. we left empty handed that night, but i'll never forget the rush.

i loved blackjack. i learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. he'd say ""i just taught you a very valuable lesson."" he actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) my uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family i was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why i hated doing anything with him. one of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than i made in a month of bussing tables. i went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things i can't even remember.

what does any of this have to do with $gme? well i'm still chasing the same high as i was when i was 18. i don't go to the casino anymore, but i've got something even better on my computer. i bought $2k worth of weeklies on jan 25. before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems i've caused in my life. but, i was still standing around that craps table. the roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $gme was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! i put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. a few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, i'm back to nothing.

now i do what every moron around the table does. you reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""just let it happen one more time. i won't be greedy this time and i'll stop when i hit 50k."" i stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. yeah, that'll be how i get back to 50k. a couple of those in a row and i can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, i'm on my way out to the car and i feel like i've been punched in the gut. again.

every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. everyone has their game. the people holding $gme stonks right now? you're playing baccarat. if you've never heard of it, it's what james bond plays in the old movies. it's about the most boring thing you can do. two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. there's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

the people who cashed out and picked something else like $amc or $bb? those are the slot players. you had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". you're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

the people saying ""if daddy elon or cowboy cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" you're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

tldr: nothing is happening with $gme. stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" billionaires are not coming to bail you out. if institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. you can't trigger shit by holding. the hfs will outlast you.

smart money makes you money. 

this is not financial advice. do your own dd. 

look before i get into it, when i pick stocks i like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there eg cathie wood, michael burry.

the stock i am talking about is cvs 

well, i couldnt believe my eye balls when i saw the og goat- dr michael burry had 10% of his portfolio in cvs. 

a lot of people ask for dd on stocks that havent done 100%+ in the last month. well this is it and i am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. strap in.

\#1 covid vaccines- there is a potential for cvs to open up a section of there locations to administer covid vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. meaning money from the government to cover this. secondly,  have you ever gone to cvs and just picked up your meds? i sure havent. i leave with that much sh!t i didnt need its not funny. so imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. like oh wow, my wifes boyfriend could use these 10 packs of gatorades and vibrating cuck ring.  so, increase in sales 

\#2- fundamentals- skip this is if you dont believe in the f word. 

 according to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to its fair value

 pe ratio is 11.9x which is lower than the industry average of 19x and market 25x

 future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

 long term assets $173.68 b vs $101.74b liabilities

 \*concern over short term assets $59b vs short term liabilities $62b

 debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

 interest payments on debt well covered by ebit (6.4x) 

 dividend pay out that has been stable and is well covered by earnings 

\#3 new ceo karen lynch- i am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. there are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique in house offerings. 

\#4  institutional  ownership 

 vanguard $6.4 b (8%)

 blackrock $5.6 b (7%)

 state street $3.4b (4%)

 capital research $2.8 b (3.5%)

 morgan stanley $1.5b (1.8%)

\#5 bureau of healthcare working on their side

amazons disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. at some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 more than a pharmacy 

 aetna  health insurance plans 

 minute clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

 cvs intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

 potential vaccine adminsting stations.

the game is rigged but  can still win!,586,lfxpvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxpvy/the_game_is_rigged_but_can_still_win/,123,1612886447.0," 

disclaimer: i'm not a professional in this field. this is not financial advice. i'm not even owning gme or any stocks for that matter but i'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

for every gme stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a gme stock becomes available for borrowing. we can pump gme forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. they know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. they are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. and even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

there are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. if you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* gme steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

people own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy gme. twice. just to get out of this bet.

i think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without gme taking action. with gme taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

am i wrong? how long do you think shorters can stay afloat? at which price point? how can i buy gme without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???

**the best part**

they are expecting nearly **$2 billion** in revenue for 2021. and the current market cap is $4.16 billion. they are literally trading at only about twice the 2021 revenues. which is the cheapest valuation for a company growing at this rate. [amd is trading at over 10 times their expected revenues in 2021...](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e44df3ff133f4000628a0be/960x0.jpg)

for such a small market cap stock, crsr is an absolute steal 

and they are profitable quarterly and yearly! planning to launch a bunch of new stuff this year. 

potential acquire target which will sent them over 40% up overnight.

the stock will double in no time..buy!

the biggest thing with on is institutional ownership. so if you dont want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

im a big fan of hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging ev, alternative energy, aerospace, and 5g markets. with demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether on or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

on in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semis it will explode similar to plug power, which was a near identical situation. although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. i believe we are going to see a large spike in theta value by april, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. you can get atm contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by april to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what id call a great options deal. 

note: i dont provide sell points, so dont ask. every post ive made provides the opportunity to make money, it wont change with on, dont be to greedy, and take your free money once its there.",799,799,0.87,False,2021-02-09 06:46:29

general: 
during a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. you can look back at the 08 09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after michael burry got famous. [1]
   
  

next, we have the catalysts, joe biden. according to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. biden will act quickly, and aggressively. hes working with congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put america on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. while also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. not really lastly, but also make $400bn as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) all while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. this is within his biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment which also pertains to the auto industry such as ev gov vehicles, see wkhs as an example.[2][3]  
    

energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. it's too late! false. so has everything, even giants like apple are up over 100% since march lows.   clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

hydrogen: 
recently mercedes-benz spins off its truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. while premium sedans have largely been adopting the ev mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] recently ballad power systems $bldp signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

nuclear::
now, we have solar, wind, hydrogen and what else? well, reasonably speaking you also have uranium to nuclear energy. did you know that the world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? right now there are 442 nuclear reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in us, france, china, russia and japan (rip) this consume 200 million pounds in uranium per year. we are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

utilities have been underbuying uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. we also have elon musk talking about nuclear bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkh-uvqg9oi [4][5]
  



# if i had to choose a single ticker from each, i would choose **$fcel** for hydrogen, **$nxe** for nuclear, **$enph** for solar

the tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. if you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

tickers: $fcel, $bldp, $plug, $nxe, $enph or if you want etfs, $tan, $fan, $pbw (shout out to $icln gang) 
  
final: this was way longer and harder than i anticipated to put together. we still have energy storage, wind, and i didnt even address solar reasons, biofuels or natgas. but these are my big bets for 2021. i'm aware ev is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
i'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

disclaimer: i am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

so, where to begin with $bb? we have seen the rise and fall of so-called, ""meme stocks"" to which $bb was grouped in with. shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($bb, $nok, etc.) while the focus remained on $gme and $amc.

i am writing this because i, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $bb because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. in the article below we see that $bb's qnx technology is being utilized with motional's autonomous vehicle design. this is as of feb 9, 2021 (today!)

here we see, ""[blackberry limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (nyse: bb; tsx: bb) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [qnx neutrino real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) operating system (rtos) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming gac new energy aion models from the ev arm of [gac group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (guangzhou automobile group co., ltd.).""

for those of you who don't know, baidu is a chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 billion dollars. this is huge news.

as if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in dec of 2020 a partnership with aws to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

i find this all super promising as it appears that $bb has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

whether this is short or a long term play, i like the stock!

if you buy a cfd from, say, etoro or equivalent you will not impact any short squeeze scenario since the actual asset (share) is not owned by you and where applicable you will not be entitled to any share dividends either. 

if you want to help impact the market please ensure you are actually buying the stock you are bidding for. cfds are just a form of spread betting.

&#x200b;

**major highlights**

* 55% increased revenue yoy
* over 100% increased revenue
* full year of surpassing earnings expectations
* outlook to increase revenue by another 5-10% throughout 2021

**competitors**

* primary competitor is logi.  crsr outpaces logi in earnings growth.  crsr operates at a market cap of 4b, compared to logi's 15b, despite having a revenue approx. half of logi's, pointing to crsr being undervalued.

**issues**

* low float, leading to higher volatility.  can be a benefit if looking at playing options spreads (keep that iv crush away from me)
* ipo lockup.  ends on march 22, so expect a potential decrease as early investors take profits.

overall, crsr has another quarter of showing a quickly growing company with a huge chunk of their market.  bullish

the important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. we joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. the majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. you don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. maybe they are trying to look out for you. maybe not.

at the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. what happens here might influence the market, but i've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price. don't put in what you can't risk to lose; it isn't worth it.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * u.s. stock futures fell tuesday, taking a pause after the dow jones industrial average and s&p 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. all three benchmarks logged record-high closes. februarys blistering gains ahead of tuesdays trading on wall street sent the dow, s&p 500 and nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. trumps second impeachment trial to begin in senate

> * former president donald trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last months deadly riot at the u.s. capitol. despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term republican president, ensconced at his florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many gop lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. the trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. et.

*****

> # 3. cbo says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as president joe biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released monday by the nonpartisan congressional budget office. the hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. doing so could enable the democrats to pass bidens $1.9 trillion covid stimulus approach with no republican votes. as part of the pandemic relief effort, house democrats on monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. who says animals to humans most likely path of coronavirus

> * an international team of scientists led by the world health organization said tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a work in progress, but the most likely pathway was indeed from animals to humans. scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the chinese city of wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. the team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as extremely unlikely.

*****

> # 5. reddits valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * reddit  ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania  raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. activity in reddits wallstreetbets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like gamestop skyrocketing last month. shares of the video game retailer  which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week  dropped another 5.9% on monday and were under pressure in tuesdays premarket.

gevo is still a small cap, but they might totally play along xom (200 billion), shell (120 billion) or bp (74 billion) in a couple of years. worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, i just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under biden.

also i should mention that you're basically helping the environment by investing in this. you'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.

what happened: the social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include tencent holdings ltd (otc: redacted), andreessen horowitz, and sequoia capital, according to crunchbase.

reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by vy capital, the wall street journal reported.

reddit ceo steve huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'valuations are very high right now. it never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the journal pointing to a 90% yoy increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended december.

why it matters: reddit has been in the limelight after r/wallstreetbets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of gamestop corp (nyse: gme), amc entertainment holdings inc (nyse: amc), blackberry ltd (nyse: redacted, nokia oyj (nyse: redacted) and others.


'we are also readying to double the number of reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

reddit purchased video-based social media platform dubsmash in december.

bionano genomics - why you should care about it,1280,lfluvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfluvn/bionano_genomics_why_you_should_care_about_it/,358,1612847187.0,"first of all, i'm not a financial advisor and i like certain stocks more than others.

i was skeptical about investing in [bionano genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. but, i got interested - i read, and i read, and i followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and i got hooked.

without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

i became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

[dr. gordana r. from children's hospital los angeles presents findings that show saphyr detects druggable genetic fusions in pediatric acute leukemias  ...](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodstoryid=4789689684773596)

that story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). there are many others.

analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[if analysts raise pt to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

there's plenty of speculation on whether or not arkg is going to take them on, but honestly, i don't really care. people over at r/bngo seem to love to debate that, but, personally, i really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that i plan to hodl this for years, whatever happens.

finally, here are my positions. it's not much, but i'm working on it. i sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. i described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bngo/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

i don't want to speculate about price going to $x in y months, so i can't suggest any long calls and i don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. also, i know, this is not r/investing and i should fuck off and take my shit there. that's fine too. i'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

"theres a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13g filings etc)",721,lfpkl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,143,1612857533.0,"hello all,

so reading the gme thread theres a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the s. hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

i am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. i have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13g filings - 
so we are seeing new 13g filings by institutional investors. what does this mean? 

i can tell you with 99% certainty they arent buying. this stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. only a passion investor would pay inflated prices for a stock. if we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

i will say most will be institutional selling. these funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. as an example lets say its 3% if the basket. as the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! so they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

if the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. this isnt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

this is why etfs dont go parabolic and are considered safe they hedge and manage risk. 

edit: i left out the important part! to see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13g it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. that will tell you the change. 

shares available to borrow-

as stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. the cost to borrow is low right now, thats because the share price is dropping. share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. but the share price and volatility are the most important. if its raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. why? because theres more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. if its moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

the shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


current si -

i would not be surprised to see si still above 70%. remember, 30% is very high. 

but something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from december. let me explain. 

december short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. that means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. so some were margin called and hf to cover positions. driving the cost up. but there were new shorts who couldnt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. see at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

the stock price touched $500 in premarket. these shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. you have to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. these guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. these are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didnt trigger this thing alone. we dont have that kind of capital here. hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. and back then we werent nearly this big and most not even active! 

there will be reports tomorrow after hours. remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. so take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

is this over? - 

who fucking knows, i hope not! but this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. this was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). im rooting for yall but mechanically its a lot harder to trigger. 

this isnt financial advice just spreading information as i see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. not meant to be either bullish or bearish. but i am rooting for you retards.",721,721,0.92,False,2021-02-09 02:58:53
weekly stock market news | goog / amzn / pins / sq / pypl / cost & other stock market news [02-08],6302,lfb2w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfb2w4/weekly_stock_market_news_goog_amzn_pins_sq_pypl/,357,1612817245.0,"**the stock market finished a terrific week at record highs companies like google, pinterest, amazon & others smash earnings reports while jeff bezos bows out lets talk about this & other stock market news**

hello everyone! so, lets start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the sp500 & nasdaq composite finishing at new record highs while the dow jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. for the week the [dow](https://imgur.com/nqpg47q) gained 3.9%, the [sp500](https://imgur.com/cy3wx9n) rose by 4.65% and the [nasdaq composite](https://imgur.com/t5qgyg5) outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early november 

the volatility [index](https://imgur.com/ki1rnhz) dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasnt been broken in a long while.

we saw all 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/pp8dyth) finish the week in the green, with energy leading the way followed by consumer discretionary, communications & financials also gaining more than 6% 

[here](https://imgur.com/trrk4fz) is the heat map from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was health care. the big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96q4j9w) their % of the sp market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

we also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in january as both the [ism](https://imgur.com/q9zpnxf) index and the [pmi](https://imgur.com/nvz0ode) index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

also, the [ism](https://imgur.com/jgj2ibi) services index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

in terms of job numbers, we saw [adp](https://imgur.com/a39dqcb) coming in way better than expected as over 170k jobs were added after a big drop in december. we also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftmxubp) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6m last week.

this [week](https://imgur.com/vlr3qhg) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core cpi, consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [earnings](https://imgur.com/pmp5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from twitter, coca-cola, gm, uber & pepsico while we also have to see how disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. one other thing that i am also interested to watch is the paypal investors day on thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

in some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/ecqhtmu), it seems that most of the rbnhd retail investors that have jumped ship are going to squares cash app with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. we have to see if this trend continues now, after [rbnhd](https://imgur.com/joqiln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, i think square is a nice fintech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated pos providers just like square 

we also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/gilwn3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6b on revenues as this was the first time amazon passed the $100b mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. the other big [thing](https://imgur.com/wmmaddl) we got from amazon was that bezos will step down as ceo as andy jassy the current aws leader will become the next ceo. this news caused some uncertainty for the company, but i believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world 

also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [paypal](https://imgur.com/klv5td6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions 

the other big earnings report we saw last week was from [alphabet](https://imgur.com/5boupt0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4b in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. the biggest income generator remained the search & youtube business as they are still investing huge in their cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run 

other companies also smashed earnings with [pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zb9sph) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [ford](https://imgur.com/zerclc2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that ford is progressing into turning around the company

meanwhile, though they didnt have an earnings report, [costco](https://imgur.com/6umgj7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in january as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. i believe costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in january

and finally, lets hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9kxb) stock markets and the us [futures](https://imgur.com/mlrflz5) are pointing to a good open with the nasdaq leading the way after the treasury secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfkvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

so a while back i yoloed my entire account on calls and [lost it all in 4 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/). like a sensible ""investor"" i wanted my money back, i mean who wouldn't right? so fast forward 1 week and i'm thinking ""what's the fastest way i can make my money back?"". selling puts of course. 

so i'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and i forgot i couldn't write naked options. so i went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. i started to panic because i had just lost around %80 of my account and i can't find a way to make it back. luckily, i managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that i would receive roughly the same amount of money. now, you might be asking which stock and strike price i chose. unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so i went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str fds. now, these are deep in the money puts, so i am relying on them not being exercised. you might think this is stupid but i think it's smart. who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. the only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  i only have around 8,500, so if i somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then i'm fucked. if everything works out i will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then i might $rope. it can't go tits up.

yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, rkt has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... but what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that rkt isn't a buy. when in reality, rkt is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

rkt dd part 1 will explain the market manipulation rkt is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. i will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how i believe rkt will have a similar outcome as the company i mention.

double edit: with over 40 percent short interest, a $1b buyback (that cuts rkts float in half) zero insider selling and potential catalysts - rkt could easily squeeze into the $50s in the near term if the stars align. and if it doesnt squeeze, this shit is still going to melt up. youre not investing in fucking bed bath and beyond here.",350,350,0.87,False,2021-02-09 05:21:12

the short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). the second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on fintel. for the first drop, unfortunately, i don't have an image to prove it. but, what i do remember is that for the 3rd of february the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. this one i'm willing to blame on ""updating data"".

i presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

however, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often fintel updates their stats. my screenshot was on the 5th of feb, and the current one (8th of feb). this shows that fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

my screenshot (02/06/2021):

current report (02/08/2021):

as you can see the first screenshot i had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in february compared to prior months. this was after the first correction that i had mentioned previously (the one i don't have a screenshot for).

in april of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. and february of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

i get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. but for historical data? especially with such a huge change? and all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

there was a person on stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. but all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

thoughts.

p.s i'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

p.s.p.s i'm still holding strong!

edit: a lot of people were asking what does this mean. it doesn't mean anything per se. it just shows that there is some odd movement happening with fintel's platform. one of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with fintel:

""thanks so much for reaching out to fintel with your concern! you are right. given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. given this, we have revised some historical numbers. we announced this in the welcome group and on those pages. sorry the message wasnt up for longer - i imagine that was super confusing. we will replace it again. i imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

are you certain the chart isnt updating? that is an automated process. i appreciate you writing in so i could clarify. ill resolve your ticket but im still here if you reply.""

i mean, this is possible. however, why now? why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say ""oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more ""accurate"" measurements to our users"". ya know?

**also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: borrowing fees for amc went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**edit x2:** a fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/rubinoffbuttchug69 made a similar speculation.

his post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/rubinoffbuttchug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**

and for all of you **asking about gme - the same post points out that gme also suffered from this. it's short volume got lowered by 50%.**

so their excuse is a ""programming error"". fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? but for the historical values of past months compare to february? and with the previous response they gave the other ape from wsb (if true).

wealthy investors c and d are politically aligned to b (coal).

investor c buys a long position in a, then loans out its shares to investor d with no intention to ever sell.

investor d sells the loaned shares to new investors e, f, and g.

investor d uses to proceeds from the sale to pay off the loan interest then reinvests the remainder into company b. investor d is under no pressure to cover as they have a mutual agreement c will never sell.

now in this example, consumers efg believe they are investigating in their aligned interest, wind, but in fact, the money is being immediately redistributed to coal.

so i don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. like, i've really noticed a lot of people comparing gme holders with qanon/supporters and capitol-rioters. it's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' us government.

think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

you know why they make this comparison?

because gme holders almost overthrew the us financial system.

the difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

so they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

there's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

that is why we hold.

we hold because we like the stock. i just really like the stock. that's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

unless we live within the realm of the ussa empire.

which we do.

making my rights negotiable (for a price).

is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-cdo fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

it's not my fault, actually. 

they are humans. they call themselves men. they can face the consequences.

so the qanon/capitol riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the gme hype. like  you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

by all means go ahead and deride  but make it sensible.",459,459,0.75,False,2021-02-09 03:20:05
$cgc - a goliath on their last legs.,28,lg4qkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg4qkd/cgc_a_goliath_on_their_last_legs/,21,1612910591.0,"hello all, 

i will keep this post really simple. canopy is a weed company in canada that has lost money for the past 2 years after being semi-acquired by their parent company constellation brands. **canopy is worth 17 billion dollars despite never producing a profit.**  

canopy has burned 1 billion dollars of direct cash burn over the past year and invested roughly another 1 billion in united states and canadian businesses. these investments have amount to 1.9 goodwill and a horrible cash position at 673m. 

&#x200b;

[sept 30th](https://preview.redd.it/nwnon28ungg61.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4cbe3bd3bae43ca3b36673ace4e81af09cff3a1)

canopy reported earnings today and stated that they have 1.5b in cash and cash equivalents, a loss of .39 billion (hilarious wording or $390 million) at the end of the quarter today. they have not uploaded their current balance sheet to sedar. 

so they either have less investments or spent another 170 million in direct cash. putting us at around 500 million in direct cash.

hidden in today's earnings/press release - 

 *as additional consideration for the assets being transferred and the termination of the royalty agreement, canopy growth will make a cash payment to crc of $115 million and issue an aggregate of 3,750,000 commons shares to crc.*

canopy will need to spend another 115 million and dilute shareholders to divest from another horrible canadian business they acquired back in 2018 or whatever. this will hit the books next q as canopy rivers has to vote/agree to that consolidation of capital. 

from there, we have $500 million - $115 from this settlement = $375 million in direct cash after this transaction set up for next quarter, and projected cash burn from operations at another $100 million. **to be fair, the ceo has been cutting costs and it is all over the press releases about their efforts.** 

either way, they are at to be fair $275 million in direct cash and 1.2 billion in investments going into next quarter. **they are going to have to raise capital.**

topic change, well canopy is in a growth sector. sales must be booming in canada, with a population of 35 million people! yea well, they were. in november, it actually started to decline.

\---

okay, so what about constellation helping out canopy. well if you look at the actual agreement, constellation extended the payment tranche out to november 2023. so they hold the option to deliver 5 billion dollars to canopy by november 2023. that's amazing flexibility for canopy, right?! yea you would think so, but the reason it was extended is directly related to constellation's balance sheet right now. 

constellation's last q:

now, no one is doubting constellation's ability to raise cash. they have immense liquidity, but if you actually look at their balance sheet. they have 10 billion in debt. they can either provide shares to canopy and royally fuck over current stz shareholders, or take on debt to provide it. **the deal is going to get restructured.** they will never provide 5 billion dollars to a company that can turn a profit.

there's my position. i am all in bitches. weed cannot go up forever. the company is worth 17 billion dollars. stz is not going to provide 5 billion dollars to a company that already accumulated 1.9 billion in goodwill, will need more cash to fund us legalization, and cannot even turn a profit.

i like gamestop.  i like $gme.  i believe in the long term plan (or what i/we think is the plan, anyway).  i bought a pro membership and have put in orders through the app i downloaded.  i think they'll kill 4q earnings in march.

i think gamestop is a good company.  i think cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  i think cnbc and particularly melissa lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  i think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.

my personal belief, which i require nobody else to share, is that ryan cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  but my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  i believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  and i believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  that's what i believe, and why i'm not holding positions right now.  i probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.

many of the people who have joined wsb in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  and that's okay!  but the new people (7 million new versus 1.5 million old) have done the following:

   * failed to realize there is no short squeeze on bb or nok
   * failed to realize the nok spam was purely from bots
      * while you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming nok.
   * continually asked what stock we are going to manipulate next
* tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier.
   * i saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.
* made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist
   * short ladders?  every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  every time?
   * you don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply & demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?
* with zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake
   * ""look how low volume is on this candle!  it's not a real drop!""
   * [the dip is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay22q/the_dip_is_fake_look_at_how_many_people_are/)
* called people who have been involved in this play since summer 2020 ""paperhand pussies"" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%
* turned wallstreetbets into a political activism forum
* denying reality
   * s3 partners is not lying to you.  they and ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced from the highest level that any stock has ever had does not mean that they're lying to you.
* spammed low-effort memes and easily-googleable questions on the new submissions
   * when your posts were taken down, you posted again
* accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot
* aggressively spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position
* i want to gag every time i see somebody write ""i'm not a financial advisor"" following a post that makes that very clear
* moving the goalposts
   * ""you are here on the vw short squeeze graph!""
   * ""we finished above $325!  gamma squeeze!"" (personal confession, i almost fell for this one and i'm glad i sold before the plummet).
   * ""ok so there was no gamma squeeze monday but tuesday is the day!""
   * ""ok we fell another 50% tuesday but definitely wednesday!""
   * ""fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!""
* accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page
   * which you then posted again
      * and again
* completely ignored the rules of our subreddit
   * market manipulation --
   * no pump & dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as gme) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.
   * political bullshit -- if you think ""it's not about the money"" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.
   * no bullshitting -- there are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by ""this is not financial advice, am ape"") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who did know what they were talking about, but op misinterpreted the meaning.
      * believe it or not, that's against the rules.  just say you dont know.  or say nothing.  there's actually no need to spam.
* gain & loss posts - nobody wants to see your loss on one-third of a share of amc.  come on.
* yolo - your investment in one-third of a share of amc is not a yolo.  a yolo is dfv leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.

* and you've now begun brigading wsb from r/gme.

you have formed a cult.  you've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  do you think that's a healthy mindset?

if this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking ***let it rip.***  i hope it works out.  seriously, i want you to make money.  i like gain porn a lot more than loss porn.

first, what is option flow and why do people use it. options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and etf's. i use it daily to help me decide what positions i want to open or at least what i should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. there are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. if anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. one i haven't used before is blackbox.

apps

titanflow

cost per month: free plan is 0$, basic plan is $30, premium plan is $50

titanflow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like webull, robinhood, tastyworks, etc... titanflow is a new app that recently launched in december if i remember right. i signed up for the premium plan and overall i would give it an 8/10. the app is broken up into 4 parts.

snapshot page: this is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. i didn't really use this page much mostly because i am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. you also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.

flow page: this is where i spent most of the time on the app. this is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. you can search for flow on specific stocks or etf's and filter them based on your needs. you have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. you can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. you can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.

today's contract page: not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. i have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but i have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. if anything i just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. you can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.

flow alerts page: you won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and etf's. you can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. for example in general i like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. you can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.

downsides: the downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like flowalgo might have. flow crashed the app once. to be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash i think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. i believe it caused cheddarflow and optionsflow to have issues as well. the last real downside i see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.

optionsflow

cost per month: free plan is $0(has ads), basic plan is $20

this app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that i could find besides titanflow so i feel like i should review it just in case it gets better in the future. for now, i would stay far away. i would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. optionsflow has been around since november and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad i feel like they are trying to copy titanflow because they recently made their own snapshot page. i paid $20 for their basic plan. their app is also broken into four parts.

snapshot page: this page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is i paid for the premium service but i am still having ads blasted in my face. besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.

today option flow page: this page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that i have reviewed. now you may love or hate this but i ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (you can only see what is being bought and not sold) i like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. optionsflow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but its better than nothing. the last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says ""there is no options flow today"" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.

historical option flow page: not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is exactly the same as the flow page. the only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.

dark pool prints page: i did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. i checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.

downsides: there is a lot of downsides right now so i would stay far away from this for now. when i pay for a product i want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.

websites

flowalgo

cost per month: $150

i enjoyed using flowalgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. the way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. the platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. flowalgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. in the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. the dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. one of the best features is that flowalgo lets you spot dark pools. you can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. it also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. i would give it a 9/10. flowalgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. 

downsides: this service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. another downside i have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.

cheddarflow

cost per month: standard plan $85, professional plan $99

if you cannot afford flowalgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. cheddarflow definitely feels like a watered-down flowalgo but still valuable. the layout is simple which i liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to flowalgo. cheddar flows run_main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. i did find their service much easier to understand than flowalgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. overall i would give this website a 7/10. i think if they can match flowalgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.

downsides: expensive for what you are getting. i feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and i have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.

i have spoken. you may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. hope this helps.",706,706,0.95,False,2021-02-08 21:59:17
how to read dd on wsb.,758,lfi3va,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,70,1612837388.0,"so you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  so, what do you do?

analyze their analysis!

first, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   if so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new dds you'll need to be vigilant.  avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  if the op has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and i trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""i don't wanna but good luck all"".

third, the actual content of the post!  do you understand what they're pitching?  if not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    if you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  if it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  if it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    the sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding dd that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

now if you decide that you like the dd, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   and this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  does it match your risk profile?  is it a stock dd, or an options recommendation?  how much are you willing to gamble?  what is your exit strategy?  can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and i am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

let's say you don't like the dd - you're not gonna buy in.  but what if you think that the person's crazy?  what if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  you may choose to bet **against** the dd!  and yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  investing in inversing bad dd is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  as retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  if you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a dd post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

"pton - short term technical play, long term extremely bullish ",14,lg54cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg54cr/pton_short_term_technical_play_long_term/,6,1612911701.0,"this post is going to describe a play that's kinda technical. so stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.

first off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-k. if you only understand  , don't worry, i explain it in more detail with more emojis.

**tl;dr:** pton just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71m from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. they state in their 8-k  that the option counterparty is going to be buying pton stock immediately to hedge risk. however you cut it, that's likely 300k-1m+ shares that need to be bought this week, and the daily volume yesterday was 14k.

[https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750)

## the play

if that was gibberish, i'll try to spell it out. pton just sold $1b of convertible notes to wall street.

***what are convertible notes?***

convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the debtor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. you could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.

***what's a call option?***

gtfo

***but wait, isn't creating new shares bad? wouldn't that dilute the stock?***

congrats on following along, normally yes. normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. but pton is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be ""in the money"".

***what's the ""strike price"" for pton's convertible notes?***

this is called the conversion price. the notes are only worth more than their face value if pton closes above **$240/share**.  that's 65% upside from today.

***how big is the loan?***

pton initially offered $600m of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90m. clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875m with the option to purchase an additional $125m.

***is there an expiration date?***

neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.

***what's the interest rate?***

get this, it's **0% interest**.

let me repeat all that, as it's insane. **the debtors agreed to let pton owe them $1b for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into pton shares at $240/share in 4 years.**

meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks pton shares are going to be worth at least $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.

***what's the significance of pton using call options?***

they state in their 8-k that **they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase pton common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing**. pricing was finalized this morning. this will happen this week. in order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. how many, i don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70m in call spreads that are $116 wide, i assume anywhere between $50m of shares to something like $150m. that's about \~300k-1m shares. that's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.



**how to play this?**



buy call options and shares. i am personally going with 6/18 $160c. i will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as i see pton as a long term play. you can choose something closer to expiration.

caveat, the short term play may not work out. if you buy fds you might lose your money. the counterparty may do an otc transaction that gets reported at a later date. i don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis.

if you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually.

## long term bullish stuff

this is going to be a subjective argument. as a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. i'm being honest with you that i've neither put in the work nor am i qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.

that being said, i have some financial advice for you: pton is going to the moon   and you should take a bullish position if you like money.

yes, i've read all the bearish crap about their financials. the thing is, companies look risky until they don't. i think this one will break out. clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.

## fundamentals

***institutional ownership?***

70%. wall street is bullish af on this. 

***why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?***

i mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor.

pton really is the first luxury product in this category. they really succeeded in making the product aspirational. people *want* to own this bike. there is a certain apple like feel to it. it's a class signifier. it says something about the owner. it looks pretty. you can display it in your living room if you want.

it's cheaper than an equinox membership. yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.

if you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. if you're gonna hate your janky bike from aliexpress, you won't use it.

pton keeps reporting quarter after quarter that **they are supply limited:** they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. this is flying off the shelves like teslas.

their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.

***end of the pandemic?***

your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. the changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. i don't expect people to go back to gyms. lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. i hate gyms so much. people stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.

the experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. i have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. that's really all your gym needs. gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.

***positions***

6/19 160c

why altria ($mo) leaps may have huge asymmetric upside ,210,lfqbrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfqbrx/why_altria_mo_leaps_may_have_huge_asymmetric/,135,1612859834.0,"**tl;dr: vaping, marijuana, michael burry, low as fuck iv, hugely under-valued company **

  


*\*disclaimer: i am not a financial advisor. this is not investment advice. all information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. please do your own due diligence before investing your money. i currently hold a long position on various altria leaps.\**

  


 nicotine products have been in continuous use in north america for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_tobacco). upon the arrival of the spanish to the new world, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across europe, but also in far-flung asia and the ottoman empire. the only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 by the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. all of your grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

we are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and big tobacco became public enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

fast forward to today. for the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

no company has lately fared worse than altria ($mo). despite growing income at a 5.9% cagr since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in juul, a 45% stake in chronos (a canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in anheuser-busch.

these investments have performed poorly over the past few years. high-profile teen deaths from illicit thc vaping products were widely linked to juul usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing altria to write-down its initial $12b investment in juul to a value of only \~$2b today. the bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of altria's chronos stake. and the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of anheuser-busch.

despite the short-term pitfalls, i will argue that it is reasonable to believe that altria has positioned itself very well for the future. and with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, i believe $mo is ripe for a turnaround.

**i have a 2023 price target for $mo of $90 which, given the low iv altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on mo jan 2023 65c leaps.**

my thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200b;

1. the company's core business is under-valued
2. vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. michael burry's scion asset management is heavily invested in $mo

**1) the company's core business is under-valued**

altria enjoys a stunningly low forward p/e of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=mo). various online discounted cash flow analyses of altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/nyse/company/altria-group-inc/dcf/present-value-of-fcff) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). these analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

there are also bright spots in altria's miscellaneous businesses that these dcf models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of anheuser-busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to covid.

we'll ignore these bright spots for now and give altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*please note: i am not a doctor. all health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research i've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. the big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. for instance, michael blaha, m.d., m.p.h., director of clinical research at the johns hopkins ciccarone center for the prevention of heart disease, says about vaping theres almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes. [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3a%20vaping%20is%20less%20harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in juul was its best way to position itself for the future. since then, juul's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. however, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized thc products unlinked to juul [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). juul's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

the ftc filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block altria's stake in juul [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). this case is due to be heard this spring. the uncertainty around juul's future has weighed on $mo, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) altria is forced to divest its stake in juul

this is not ideal, but as part of the juul acquisition, altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against juul. if altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of juul (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) altria is allowed to keep its stake in juul

in this case, altria can capitalize on juul's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. altria can then flood juul with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. this is the ideal case in my opinion, for both juul and altria.

setting aside juul for the moment, altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the usa phillip morris's fda-approved iqos product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). this is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. this product is already popular in europe and japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the usa. one major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for thc and cbd vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). in fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about altria's entry into the market that senate majority leader chuck schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""i dont want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (note however that, while this position may play well with senator schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) michael burry's scion asset management is heavily invested in $mo**

would this really be wallstreetbets if i didn't mention michael burry? burry's fund scion asset management had 5% of its portfolio in $mo as of q3 2020, making altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=sam](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=sam)). for context, this is about half the weight that michael burry's fund had in gamestop during the same quarter.

if nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**summary**

in summary, it's likely that the true value of altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $mo adding an additional 20-30b in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

iv for 2023 leaps sits at \~20%. mo jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. if altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. this would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

for this reason, i believe that altria leaps represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. please let me know your thoughts below, i'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",210,210,0.88,False,2021-02-09 03:37:14

i did some research looking for a stock in alternative energy. i had no clue what i was doing. 

i bought a small amount of a stock i liked. it jumped in three months. currently double when i got in. i am happy.

i decided to dive in and look at the stock more closely to identify what was going on and maybe apply it to other stock picks.

i then read this pick was terrible, things like the company is ""in dire straights"", the stock is too ""volatile"", ""over valued"", etc. everything i read is doom and gloom and my instincts are supposedly shit.

i can't even find consistent information about the company. 

is there any place to get reliable information i can trust that isn't blatant manipulation?

$30? really, $30? look at it like this, if the thursday scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep pltr at your pt, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into palantir like the hot girl on campus, and er being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

and note, remember during the scare phase last week, they were saying $29/28? before the reversal, below to $24 and below? before that when it tripled in a few months? catch my drift?

like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. in your eyes, who do you follow? do you listen to the citron clown calling for $15 or the institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

a lot of these bearish fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. but not 1 of them seems to mention that pltr is still up +5% for the day lol. and on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". all this anxiety under a bright green day. gtfoh.

to the longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$pltr](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/pltr) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. understand, big daddy institutions got to squeeze you poor retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ath's whilst **you get screwed**. this is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. to win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. when they bend you over for what you're worth, you say no!!

quite simply palantirians and - to noobs - palantards, remain long and hard; we can't be stopped. palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. short volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. mm can hold us down for only so long. it's a stock that has 2 more **major catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. the gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

for every gme stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a gme stock becomes available for borrowing. we can pump gme forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. they know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. they are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. and even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

there are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. if you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* gme steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

people own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy gme. twice. just to get out of this bet.

i think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without gme taking action. with gme taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

am i wrong? how long do you think shorters can stay afloat? at which price point? how can i buy gme without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???",1547,1547,0.69,False,2021-02-08 18:03:18

**clean energy fuels corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in north america. 

as of right now they are currently involved in:

* regional fleets of trucks

* commercial airlines

* public transit

* construction vehicles

* ships/cargo boats/vessels/cruise lines

**argument #1**

undervalued. at it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/bnb6mnx) 

**financials**

* market cap - 2.94b

* p/e ratio - 79.62 

* cash on hand - 96 million

what causes a companies value to go up? the potential for future catalysts. with biden in presidency, clne is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across north america. it's reign has just begun.  



**argument #2**

biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. he plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. he's only been in office since january 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. if you read [president biden's plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **tldr:** biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

while electric vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **clean energy fuels corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve biden's goals.

**argument #3**

the recent hype and growth of the opportunities in clean energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. the company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

the [ceo, andrew littlefair](https://imgur.com/ekoqd7z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. current shares outstanding are 198m, and of this, the ceo himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. he definitely believes in the company!

**my price targets**

i believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by june, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [la transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3a-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

the potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to clean fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *many* more catalysts in the future. the surface has only just been scratched.

sony's most recent game developer acquisition is *insomniac games*  which includes spider man, ratchet and clank , spyro ect ect.

now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?

i believe qualcomm has been brutally oversold. i expect a large rebound in the following months. 

following their [most recent earnings report q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of february their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. however, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong q2 earnings too with an eps of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an eps of $1.57). the q1 er had an eps of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their q1 2020 $0.99 eps. although their er beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. they had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. they do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. they can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on r&d.


all sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? ive looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. however, i believe this is bullish. with demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. furthermore, i do not believe the dip is for this reason as other us chip producers such as broadcom, nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. amd has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 it is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their pt to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) this is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so youd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of march. [the most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, i do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following eps for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

&#x200b;

\*this post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200b;

tldr: rush street interactive ($rsi) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $rsi grossly undervalued. a massive blow out at q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200b;

\*\*overview\*\*

""sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - niccolo de masi, ceo dmy technologies

&#x200b;

rush street interactive ($rsi) operates the [betrivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. they are now fully licensed and operating in new jersey, pennsylvania, michigan, illinois, indiana, colorado, iowa, and virginia. they own and operate a casino in new york and already have a new york license making them well positioned for liberalization there. they merged with a dmy technology group spac on dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

the online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. estimates put the online casino market at double the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$rsi is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in pennsylvania, illinois, indiana, and colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as new jersey. they also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. the female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south america as legalization continues. this means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200b;

\*\*the financials and strategy\*\*

unlike other companies in the space rush street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on return on invested capital (roic). q3 gross revenue was $71.9 million. q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that q4 revenue could be as high as $120 million.

paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of draftkings 2021 guidance of $750m.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayc](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayc)

&#x200b;

what is striking when compared to $dkng is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in q3 while $dkng spent 155% of their revenue. this will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. this company should actually be valued close to $dkng based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/rqqxtgg](https://imgur.com/a/rqqxtgg)

&#x200b;

their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. the sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $dkng will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*this cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $rsi.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzjj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzjj26n)

&#x200b;

as i said before i expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. my estimate is that their revenue will be around 110m for q4. i also expect guidance to be raised to 500m for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened michigan market as well as their sports book launch in virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/cktqhhh](https://imgur.com/a/cktqhhh)

&#x200b;

\*\*short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

the short interest on $rsi sits at 5.08 m shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. now why would a company already valued at 2.8 billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 billion compared with $dkng and $penn be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? my conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200b;

\*\*commander in gilf cathie wood is bullish on the sector\*\*

on feb. 2nd ark disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $dkng. this is extremely bullish for the sector. i am highly confident that after q4 earnings ark will be purchasing shares in $rsi as well due its strategic advantages relative to $dkng and exposure to the female demographic. for such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200b;

\*\*final notes\*\*

jerome ""[the bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=penlun7pkto)"" bettis, steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... this company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and gen x degenerates. keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

this stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. the terms of the spac deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. this is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. i plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200b;

i will post a part 2 breaking down their latest s-1 filing and q4 revenue by state when they release their q4 earnings date.

extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds,54,lfu7mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfu7mj/extraordinary_popular_delusions_and_the_madness/,138,1612872480.0,"the title of charles mackays book keeps echoing in my head as i watch the gme crowd continue to desperately milk whats left of probably the best trade this century. a trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. a beautiful trade in its sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions i have ever witnessed.

its become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasnt been seen since trump convinced his supporters to storm the capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. while others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

i feel like i may have played a very small part in this with my cnbc open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. as one retard here put it, this is not occupy wall st. this is wallstreetbets, we fucking love wall st. so with that said im making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as dd.

people claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the nyse. there is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. everyone can do this, including you. every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their how to use options section. 

people claiming shorts havent covered yet despite data released by the exchanges and s3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by warren buffet.

on a final note, im going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. displacement**

a displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. boom**

prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. during this phase, the asset in question (gme) attracts widespread media coverage. fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. euphoria**

during this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay moreplays out everywhere. for example, at the peak of the japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of manhattan property. similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in march 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the gdp of most nations.

**4. profit-taking**

in this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting pointstarts selling positions and taking profits. but estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [john maynard keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. panic**

it only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. in the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. as supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. one of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in october 2008, weeks after [lehman brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and fannie mae, freddie mac and aig almost collapsed. the s&p 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. in that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

gme is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. for those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. for those that bought over $300 and are still holding. congrats, you just played yourself and have brought shame to your family, your village and all of china.",54,54,0.55,False,2021-02-09 07:08:00

# what is $bio?

marketcap: **18.58b.** price:  628.68. average analyst target price (yahoo finance): **677.50** 

they have basically two segments. the first is research oriented providing reagents, apparatus, instruments and other stuff to organizations that do science (i.e. government agencies, pharmaceuticals, biotech, universities and medical schools and many other labs.) 

second segment is their clinical diagnostics segment are test systems, informatics systems, and test kits.

# are they making good money?

eps (ttm) is 116.69, it's actually earning a lot of money compared to gme (guh). i found this stock filtering for high earning companies because of my gme shares lol.

# how do they fare against all the other bio testing stonks?

let's see how many pcr machines they sell compared to others. imo, it further highlights how absurdly discounted bio-rad is compared to other suppliers.

[these are from thomas.net, an unbiased source talking about finding suppliers for various industries. see bio-rad on #9 top supplier. but qiagen right above it at #8, trades at 67.29 per \(yahoo finance\) compared to bio-rad's 5.18.](https://preview.redd.it/ikvfqh3njcg61.png?width=2085&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e1e7fefa729e46a16c188660aa4b669142822e)

# so is bio-rad actually selling equipment??

let's ask the scientists.

a scientist chick called mary johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using bio-rad / other suppliers to see what pcr equipment labs should buy.

>three suppliers dominate the citations. they are thermo fisher, **bio-rad** (including brand mj research)  and roche. the most cited models are thermo fisher 7x000 series, icycler/myiq from **bio-rad** , and lightcycler from roche.

scientists seem to love their bio-rads dude, so even if covid testing goes away, sciencey lab big brains will still buy bio-rad products.

lets face it, gme isnt going to the moon anytime soon. the short sellers and market makers can replicate as many share ious as they want to keep up with any retail buyer demand. and since the stock isnt paying dividends, and the companys revenue is going down the toilet, theres really no big downside to them doing so. maybe ryan cohen could turn around the company someday, but that could take years.

anyways id like to see this sub return to its roots. ban all the newcomers especially people who only talk about gme. anyone else agree? theres more stocks to invest in than gme, many of them more promising and with higher upside.

a gambler's guide to gme. how to use expected value to help make decisions.,434,lff0y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,85,1612829287.0,"i am not a financial advisor. this is not financial advice. if you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. i am doing this only with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

the expected value (ev) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. you calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. if the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. gamblers win by making positive ev decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

expected value (ev) = ((total negative outcomes)\*(likelihood of occurrence)+(total positive outcomes)\*(likelihood of occurrence))

* if ev>0 hold! do not fold! i might consider buying more with funds that i can stand to lose.
* if ev=0 grey area. you aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* if ev<0 accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. if you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. yes, i said it.

with this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. we will only look at the price that it is today. for simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

so let's say i think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the chewy guy and all that.

so negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. what's my target price? let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say i estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

ev =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

ev=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

ev=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (expected ev is positive from our assumptions, i should hold!)

and the fabled $69,420? i'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven ev is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. if i thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, i should at least hold my position.

so you're telling me there's a chance!

yeeahhh! -lloyd christmas

**now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than i presented or could be more (or less). that's fair. i might be wrong, but this is what i am looking at and the way i am looking at it. do your own dd.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. i used what i feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. the hedge funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive ev for them. if you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

tldr: based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",434,434,0.85,False,2021-02-08 19:08:07

fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year i  believe nvda earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. however, its going to be a slow rally till then. i encourage wsb to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their amd dd after it jumped 10% !

i'm not a financial advisor, i just been like the stock, along with crsr and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. the market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so amd is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **the boomers have not bought in as much as they could yet**. social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing amds retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. i usually would say amd is just an **options** play for me, but i actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. it would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in valhalla

extra dumb question about amc,241,lfiug0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiug0/extra_dumb_question_about_amc/,175,1612839346.0,"ok, so yes, i know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, wanda (which owns 60% of amc) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and i'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.

so here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?

i know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and amc isn't a good long long, but here is why i ask - i work in entertainment research. i know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. but it's real. the potential is there, the ship could still be turned.

anyways, i know i'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, i also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? it's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?

feel free to tell me why i'm stupid.

&#x200b;

what is huya?

huya inc. operates live game streaming platforms in china. its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, pc, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. the company operates nimo tv, a game live streaming platform primarily in southeast asia and latin america. it also provides online advertising and marketing services. in addition, the company provides software development and internet value added services. as of december 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. the company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in guangzhou, the peoples republic of china. huya inc. is a subsidiary of tencent holdings limited.

&#x200b;

* with tencent's backing, huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in china, douyu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in china.
* news broke out that china has anti-trust concerns with said merger between huya and douyu. the 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 sma.

$sklz is the only straight play on an american company with online gaming esports streaming potential. their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. recent nfl multi year contract with no mobile product yet. the only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their bingo, pool, solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. careful with this one as once nfl takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83b valuation based on 162m revenue grossing 153m. great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no nfl mobile app. for the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162m x 100 to even get close to the 15.83b valuation.

huya trades under 4x revenue (revenue **1.53b |** market cap  **5.77b)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. where else can you find such a gem in this market? the 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. with or without the merger between huya and douyu this stock is a buy at the current valuation. china and anti-trust concerns are a joke. baba had anti-trust concerns in dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. baba is valued at 710.47b.

the much anticipated finra report is published tomorrow after market closes. we're still in the dark about actual numbers for short positions, and we don't know much about what the hedge funds are up to. however, the way i see it based on what we've witnessed so far, their run_main strategy is one  of these two:

case 1 - heavy manipulation of the data and the stock itself. if they chose to employ this strategy, they've most likely deemed the potential cost of fines/lawsuits more manageable than the losses from an uncontrolled short squeeze. if this is the case the numbers we've been given are manipulated or straight up false and the majority of shorts have not been covered. their survival relies on retail investors selling due to fud. all of this falls apart if finra reports a high short interest  tomorrow. their only reasonable option in this case is to keep lying; the finra report will show a low short interest.

case 2 - they're already covering their shorts one way or another. if this is the case the hedge funds have been more honest than most of us give them credit for. the estimates for the short interest have had a strong trend downwards, and if the estimates are accurate the squeeze has probably been squoze. it went down from more than 100% to 50% in a matter of days and i wouldn't doubt that it'll be even lower when the report comes. in other words, even in this case the finra report will show a low short interest.

even if reality is some mix between both cases, there is in my mind no way they'll report a high short interest tomorrow. otherwise everyone will jump back in and we'll at least get a repeat of what happened 2 weeks ago (peaking at \~490). essentially, if the finra report comes with low short interest all paper hands will have sell orders ready for when market opens. the hedge funds will certainly make use of that opportunity.

i know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today. he was a guy who was more interested in finance and public markets than most and wanted to have a forum where he could discuss single stock trades. he tried this on other outlets but was always told thats too risky most stock pickers underperform you are better off buying index funds. the thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.

if you came here because you thought gamestop was the only way to make money in the market, then you need to take a step back and do some research. we take big risks here, but again, we know theyre risky and we know what we should be doing in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.

i genuinely encourage all new members to come back after youve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. almost anyone can make money buying index funds. it might not be huge money, but its how most people are able to retire these days. 

most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. most options expire worthless (theta gang). you should know your risks before you come in with your nihilistic outlook and try to protest hedge funds by taking the losing end of their trades.",133,133,0.8,False,2021-02-08 22:54:30

the size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- the market cap of the company: for a huge company like jnj, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? the larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the fda grants priority date to certain drugs. these are referred to as pdufa events.

here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

i have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 feb 21 [$regn](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/regn) evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small

* 28 feb 21 [$atnx](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/atnx) oral paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

my positions:

i have invested some money only in srpt and atnx. in srpt, because it had a huge drop recently and i hope an approval will trigger a recovery. atnx because i think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. i haven't researched the rest.

*****

> # 1. wall street set to rise after best week since november

> * dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at mondays open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock averages closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. the s&p 500 and nasdaq on friday closed at record highs, while the dows gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing january jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help americans and u.s. businesses during the pandemic. all three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since november. the reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of gamestop lost 70% last week, even with fridays 19% gain. the previous week, the video game retailers stock soared 400%. shares rose 12% in mondays premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. yellen says biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * the u.s. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if president joe bidens $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, treasury secretary janet yellen said sunday. long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. while biden has said he wants to get gop support for his covid relief measure, democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any republican votes. republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * pennsylvania sen. pat toomey, one of donald trumps harshest republican critics in the wake of the jan. 6 attack on the u.s. capitol, said sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as very unlikely. trumps unprecedented second senate impeachment trial will start on tuesday. with a 50-50 split in the senate, it would take 17 republicans voting with every democrat to convict. if senate does so, it could also vote to bar trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. south africa suspends plans to use astrazenecas covid-19 vaccine

> * south africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with astrazenecas vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. the disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the astrazeneca vaccine may not be useful in south africa. in the u.s., astrazenecas vaccine has not been approved. only vaccines from pfizer and moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the fda. one from johnson & johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agencys vaccine advisory committee.

"yes laddering is real, ""short ladder attack"" is just editorializing the laddering of naked shorts",1905,lf4vn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/,167,1612790568.0,"i've seen a lot of back and forth among those who want to hand-wave away price manipulation because the term ""short ladder attack"" is something google doesn't return much about.

&#x200b;

**""ladder""** is a term for an investment technique that requires investors to purchase multiple financial products with different maturity dates.

&#x200b;

*legal laddering ex:*

>***bond laddering*** can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments. the idea is to separate cds, cash, bonds, annuities, and others into different ""ladders"" (or ""buckets"" or ""baskets"") depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream. low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.  
>  
>this strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio, with other assets in the stock market etc. generally an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000 is required in order to purchase 5-10 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline.

>***short put laddering or bull put laddering*** is a unlimited profit, limited risk strategy in options trading that is employed when the options trader thinks that the underlying security will experience significant volatility in the near term. to setup the short put ladder, the options trader sells an in-the-money put, buys an at-the-money put and buys another lower strike out-of-the-money put of the same underlying security and expiration date.

*illegal laddering ex:*

>***ipo laddering*** also describes a process where, in order to purchase shares at a given price, investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price. this artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price, with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price. **this practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the sec after the stock market collapse**.

\--------------------------------------

ok that was fun. we know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in ""laddering"". we know that ipo laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length; where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price.

now in the more in-depth version of the ""short ladder attack"" article written \~6 years ago that's lately been passed around, the author describes at length how ""naked shorts"" can be combined with ""laddering"" strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party. this is effectively what the blogger coined as the ""short ladder attack"" strategy.

\------------------------------------

>***naked short***  this is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. in the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. this is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. the alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulationthe lynchpin of this massive fraud.  
>  
>***the anatomy of a short attack***  abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the dtc and major clearinghouses. potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. the attack is planned to its most minute detail.  
>  
>the plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the illgotten gain. (click here for more on [**bankrupting the victim company**](http://counterfeitingstock.com/cs2.0/cs4bankruptingthevictimcompany.html)).  
>  
>when it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. the playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

\------------------------------------

tl;dr - focusing on the terminology for ""short ladder attack"" is pedantic; what's being described is the combination of a laddering price manipulation tactic combined with naked shorts. both of those things are things.

i'm pretty retarded so i can't personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public, or even those with terminal access. you'd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source.

yes, the concepts described in the ""short ladder attack"" article are real things. you can call it a number of things, but it's effectively a similar tactic to all ""laddering"" via shares neither party actually owns.

no, that doesn't mean that's definitely what happened w/ gme.

and no, you don't need a smoking gun to ask the sec to investigate it.",1905,1905,0.92,False,2021-02-08 08:22:48

since the gme hype has calmed down a bit, i present you with my first dd on this forum.

first of all, no financial analyst here. this is no investment advice and do your own research.

i will take you trough each step in my dd. sorry for the long post, but i want to have a discussion with you on my dd, possible flaws in my research etc. therefore, i will post everything i do.

**okay here we go:**

i have a background in economics. since the market nowadays is quite high, i am trying to analyze every investment i make thoroughly to minimize the risks. after november last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. however, we have increased a lot and i feel the urge to deep dive in every company i invest in.

**step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**

what my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next weeks earnings. i analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.

while doing this, me and my team have picked enphase energy.

**step 1, look at the previous realized eps and revenue vs. forecasted eps and revenue:**

first observations:

\- 2020 amazing year.

\- dip q3 2019.

\- good year 2018

\- something was going on in 2017. but there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.

\- bad year 2016, again something changed.

\- february has on average been a strong month. so buying now would on average be a good idea. this month it has increased 6% while the average for february is 24.8% (8 year average) (no statistically proven).

**step 4, ownership.**

**important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. the more recent the data, the better. we dont look at holding reported at 09/30/2020.**

\- dtcc has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before gme, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). if this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to gme, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- robinhood had x amount of available liquidity prior to gme, but they needed more than x in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after dtcc increased margin. unless rh decided to reduce their liquidity just before gme, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. if it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- robinhood had to change their rules because 1r0nyman found a loophole where he cost rh $53k

\- robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- remember the big covid crash early 2020? rh was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. they were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

the bull case for clne: a stepping stone to the future,101,lfj2k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfj2k0/the_bull_case_for_clne_a_stepping_stone_to_the/,53,1612839918.0,"this is my first dd post so please forgive me. i meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**what is clne?**

since this is pretty googleable information, i'll keept it short. clne provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the us and canada. they started out with compressed natural gas (cng) and liquified natural gas (lng), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (rng). they sell rng under the name redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) the important thing here is that rng is carbon negative.

clne also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. they currently have a shitload of stations around the us and canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. it's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

clne is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from credit suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**why natural gas?**

as i mentioned before, rng is carbon negative. more and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to clne's own website). more companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-iduskbn2a52ml)). this is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). in fact, rng has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to commiefornia's air resource board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). with demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but clne who provides both rng and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**increasing natural gas demand**

companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. with buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. i'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which rng will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

we also see an increase in demand for rng happening right now. [clne last december reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of rng](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). i believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**partnerships**

clne has entered partnerships with bp and has an upcoming one with total. with bp, [they are joint owning and operating rng facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). with bp that will share half the control, and bp fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

with total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more rng infrastructure. they will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from total. i believe total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

these deals were fairly recent, so clne is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**expansion**

well, clne was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. luckily it's paying off now. i would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce rng (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

i know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. however after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). i would actually hope they don't expand into this area because i believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative roi. 

**the numbers**

honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more i'll do it if there's interest. i'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**the play**

as more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. if you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. i do expect retracement from today's price a bit. conservative price target is $22 by summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[i am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which i purchased last week (these are printing hard). i also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/cjm6fdy/image.png) i will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that. i still think clne is a strong play and will be adding to my positions.",101,101,0.85,False,2021-02-08 22:05:18

currently in the united states a country wide ammo shortage is underway. as a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. i used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

so, i did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. primers! the part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. there are only four big primer suppliers in the united states. winchester, cci, federal, and remington. 

vsto just acquired remington and owns cci and federal. that said, i looked at the 5 year chart. vsto used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought hillary was going to take there guns). estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. the ceo of vsto has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

the current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. as of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

i'm not a financial adviser, i know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and i can't find any freedom pills for my ar.. hence, me telling you to put your $$ in vsto for more tendies.

1. low risk verus very high potential reward (the chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (this adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. you like crsp this is crispr 2.0. at most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful cspr treatments and trials.

4. crsp comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people with crspr fomo.

5. any significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons its a good stock are exact reason why its a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

tdc - deeper dd as promised,14,lfulsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfulsm/tdc_deeper_dd_as_promised/,5,1612873883.0,"**tldr**; teradata (tdc) is a data warehousing biz coming to take snowflakes cookies. stock is worth $70 in the immediate near-term, possibly $150-300 if valued like snowflake.

**overview**

teradata is an enterprise data warehousing business, i.e. tdc enables customers/businesses to access/manage data, generate insights, and use these findings to make informed decisions.

data warehousing industry / tailwinds

* data warehousing is the process of capturing, storing, managing and analyzing data. pretty catch-all phrase but this is a catch-all business, fam. it applies to literally everything.
* companies use data warehousing software to acquire, aggregate and integrate data from multiple sources (different geographies, business units, etc).
* analytical services are layered on to help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions
* total addressable market is $81 billion, according to snowflake in 2020.
   * snowflakes s-1 filing: ...the markets for analytics data management and integration platforms and business intelligence and analytics tools, which we believe we address, will have a combined value of **$56 billion by the end of 2020 and $84 billion by the end of 2023.**
   * thats an industry-wide cagr of \~15%

**company history**

tdc was a pioneer in data warehousing. the company launched in 1979 and developed a cutting edge relational database platform by 1984. tdc was acquired by at&t (ncr) in the early 90s, and created the worlds first 1tb database system for walmart in 1992. in 1996, it spun off from at&t in 96 as ncr corp. tdc spun off from ncr in 2007 as an independent company and the largest standalone data warehousing biz. so 40+ years of experience in data warehousing.

tdc was historically focused on the legacy server construct. back then, the thought of a utility-like public cloud (aws) becoming the industry standard was laughable. companies ran their own servers and relied on on-prem solutions. tdc deployed on-prem database software, servers, analytical software and related consulting services.

tdc was a well-known name in the business world; in 2008, customers included coca-cola, fedex, wells fargo and a long list of other boomer stocks. historically, ibm and oracle were listed as top competitors. pre 2014, teradata was considered the data warehousing leader (ahead of orcl, ibm) by gartner. today, its cloud product is back at the top (yes, above snowflake, see below).

over the years tdc shifted focus from the legacy data warehousing business to upselling big data analytics and marketing solutions. this was the investment case in \~2013 when i pitched the stock to my college investment club. however, tdcs legacy offering wasnt well-suited for the cloud, which was starting to gain a lot of hype and traction. this rustled everyones jimmies and tdc started to collapse from 2012-2014, when snowflake launched its cloud-based offering and started stealing market share. emerging tech like hadoop and amazons aws native offering (redshift) were also major threats.

so there you have it, tdc was king of the data warehousing hill, failed to pivot to the cloud, lost to snowflake and was in decline...until now.

**tdc today**

teradata has since rebranded itself as a hybrid cloud analytics software provider, meaning it can run its database software (teradata vantage) on-prem, in the public cloud, private cloud or all of the above. literally exactly what snowflake does, perhaps even better (more on that later).

tdc was purpose-built for complex queries. the company spent the past 40+ years leading/ innovating and accumulating 600+ patents. this ip is the result of massive spending and effort over the years - the result was a company that eventually enjoyed 25% returns on capital before snowflake went and punched them in the balls. now tdc is coming back with a vengeance to take snowflakes cookies.

tdc vantage is a fixed-cost, scalable software platform. the company is basically taking decades of research and refined technique, and migrating it to the cloud. research and development has already been paid, now it just needs to move to the cloud and print cash.

**cloud implications**

* perpetual/recurring cloud-based subscriptions are cheap. they dont involve massive up-front costs to acquire a perpetual license - like subscribing to netflix vs. buying movies yourself.
* tdcs legacy on-prem business was lumpy because of the large upfront cost, which resulted in long sales cycles and required executive/ceo-level approvals to complete a sale. new subscription-based offering is lower-cost up front and easier to sell. this will enable shorter sales cycles and faster growth.
* large scale data warehousing requires a lot of human touch/tailoring. tdc is very experienced in helping big businesses with these large database transitions. they have a solid consulting business purpose-built for this. these consultants didnt get stupid overnight - tdc can leverage its years of experience to offer a more tailored experience vs. snowflake, which has only been doing this for 6 years and doesnt have a massive consulting effort.
* while tdc has been in decline for years, its bled customers at a slower-than expected pace. this is because many tdc customers spent a shit load of money upfront to integrate their business data on tdc databases. these customers still fork over $1.5 billion to tdc per year - they will probably be converted over to the cloud-based offering (which results in more attractive economics and earnings visibility). this last part is a crucial aspect of the valuation (below).

**competitive advantages**

* *network effects*: as customers move data to the cloud, the more easily data can be exchanged between customers that share the same platform
   * snowflake cited this as a competitive advantage, so it probably applies to tdc
* *high switching costs*: adopting a large database is a time consuming process that is also a pain in the ass. once complete, people dont want to leave. this is evident in tdc customer retention even in spite of cloud disruptions.
* *cost savings*: data insights result in cost savings for the customer. this is the difference between life and death of business these days
* *intellectual property*: decades worth of ip (600+ patents) and reputation as an industry pioneer

**competitive positioning**

* not only is tdc pivoting to the cloud to survive, but research suggests that it might even be better than snowflake.
* gartner scored teradata higher than snowflake in every use case of its cloud database management systems
* teradata vantage was listed as a market leader ahead of snowflake in the gartner magic quadrant for cloud database management systems

&#x200b;

**valuation**

*snowflake (snow)*

* snowflake ipod in 2020 at an \~$80 billion valuation. they claim that they are chasing an $80 billion end market (annually), which has people excited, and rightfully so - this is a pretty exciting time for cloud-based data analytics.
* in the trailing 4 quarters, snowflake posted $480 million in revenues. the stock trades at $300, or an $80 billion market cap. this implies a \~160x price-to-sales ratio (which is frankly ridiculous imo).
* during its first earnings call, snow reported 119% revenue growth

*teradata (tdc)*

* as of close (2/8/21), tdc was a $5.3 billion company.
* in its earnings report last week, tdc reported that its emerging public cloud business reached $106 million in annual recurring revenues, up 165% from a year prior...this is ape shit growth. the type that rustles peoples jimmies.
* tdc is guiding for another 160% increase in q1 2020, and a 100% increase in fy 2021.
* in total tdc reported $1.4 billion of recurring revenue, most of this is the legacy business.
* before the earnings announcement, which caught wall street/snowflake investors off guard, tdc was valued at $2.7 billion - so its fair to say this is what the legacy business is worth. this is your valuation floor.
* at 160x revenues (what snowflake is being valued at), tdcs public cloud business is worth $17 billion. id also point out (again) that tdc is a 40-year innovator here and is rated higher than snowflake by gartner in all use-case categories.
* now, i think its fair to say that in growing the cloud business, tdc is going to convert legacy customers from the on-prem solution to the public cloud solution. if it converts another $100 million of its $1.5 billion to the cloud biz, thats another $17 billion valuation. now were looking at a $34 billion business.
* for those too retard to do the math 34 billion / 5.3 billion = 6.4x upside

**price targets**

* base case: $7 billion ($64 stock price). this is below the most recent sell side price target ($70). at $7 billion, tdcs cloud biz would be valued at $4.3 billion (43x revenues, or 75% lower than snow).
* bull case: $17 billion ($155 stock price). at this level, tdcs public cloud biz would be valued at 170x revenues (same as snow).
* moon case: $34 billion ($300+ stock price). at this price, tdcs public cloud biz would get the same valuation as snow, but we would also value another $100 million of revenues at 170x revenues, which would represent future conversions from the companys existing legacy customer base to the cloud-native solution.

**near-term catalysts**

* recent earnings results shocked the street in a positive way, but not all of the gains have been made.
* the market is flows-driven, and it takes buyside (non-retail) investors 1-2 weeks to dd a company and get comfortable with it before investing
* tdc has 20% short interest. last week's earnings were nothing short of transformative, probably will result in a quick unwind.
* people are realizing that tdc was a hidden gem and is the cheapest way to play the parabolic growth market of cloud-based data warehousing/analytics. (see todays barrons article)",14,14,0.95,False,2021-02-09 07:31:23

why to really buy gme (solid dd),2150,lf023x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf023x/why_to_really_buy_gme_solid_dd/,285,1612774092.0,"legitimate argument to invest in gme at these prices (short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). 

sherman started a turnaround of gamestop when he first took over april 2019. he cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. covid threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

when burry first invested in gme, there was a reason. what reason? he spoke with sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move gamestop forward. 

fils-aim the nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. he turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. this is shown in particular with his nintendo of america endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about reggie so i didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) 

next up we see the microsoft deal. although exact numbers aren't available that i can find, gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via microsoft. microsoft is also expanding gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use microsoft software to run the stores. microsoft doesn't want gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. with 27% of new games bought at gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

we recently saw gamestop's holiday earnings. with a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. the current p/s ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). however, this is expected to change with earnings starting in march. they are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. how are they going to pay this off!!!??? liquidating stores and consolidation. this was a cohen continuation idea that sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. a small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. additionally, we have the 300% yoy online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. this is only expected to increase moving forward. while overall sales decreased by 3% yoy, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. comparative store sales increased by 5% yoy, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. places that had significantly fewer covid numbers had over 30% yoy growth. 

next, we have the chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. out with the old, in with the new. even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. sherman listens to cohen. cohen and friends had some focuses at chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. they focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. expect the same for gamestop. this was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. all ears are on cohen and his ideas to make gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 francis: that aws engineering guy that's now heading technology!? nice. durkin: customer service vp from chewy is now in charge of gamestop's customer service!? fuck yes chewy has insanely good customer service. krueger: big filler boi from amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? dope.

  the three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly brazil, north/ south africa, se asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. however, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  the banks i have mainly been looking at are bdory (brazil), sgbly (south africa), ibn (india), among others. most of these banks havent fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if youre like me, and think pretty much every us stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. for consumer products, my play is coca-cola. these are long term plays so dont expect 30% in two days. of course, invest at your own risk.

dd - patience is a virtu,75,lfhlp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfhlp7/dd_patience_is_a_virtu/,20,1612836069.0,"well done. somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on gme. this post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. thats because i'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. all i will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice i can give you, its to trust your gut.



now lets get into it. this post is my dd that i wanted to share on $virt, not because i am recommending you to do anything, but because i enjoy researching shit because its fun and i figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



so lets get into it. i'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. if you've been here even since dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6m subscribers in the last month. i'm not going to tell you i've been around since the start, i've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since i started following a few years ago. the sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. give this reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-iduskbn29y2pw




for those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. to what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? well back in jan 2020, before the march crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. by july/august, this shot up to 25%. some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **the trend is increasing** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. so why did i even mention gme to start? well according to an analyst from piper sandler, this past wednesday set a new record for volume traded for us cash equities of **24.5 billion** . thats volume traded, not a $ amount. options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 million. for both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. one last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 million+ retail traders. **100 million** thats a fuck ton of regular joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



tldr: retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. this in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



ok cool. why does this matter? well aside from melvin securities (melvin capitals market maker/scum of the earth), there are other market makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). companies like $virt, virtu financial, that are publicly traded. lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, brokers, liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bjrx0/1/



$virt has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and eps since their ipo in 2015. this growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. according to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. this is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/virtu_2019_annualreport_final.pdf



ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $virt. and turn, higher earnings. why? this is because those ask/bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. they make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. an even bigger wet dream would be if melvin securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **fuck melvin**.



so what else? $virt has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their q3 report released in nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. and a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $virt has earnings coming up on **feb 11th**. thats this thursday. lets even take a look at their revenue growth. according to their 2019 full year report, virtu took in $1.5b in revenues. fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5b and we still even haven't seen q4 results yet. while yes, the volume in march/april played a part in this, q3 revenues were still over $650m, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. their current market cap is only ~**$5.4b** with a pe of **6.6**. talk about nice returns. time to bet on the casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



tldr: more retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $virt

tldr: **data points strongly point to hedge funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. full details below.

theres an insightful piece on [tradesmithdaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

the first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

from tradesmithdaily:

plummeting short interest along with a plummeting gme share price, in other words, could indicate that the reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out important to note that if the long holders of gme shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

the second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in gme didnt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further breaking the squeeze.

\*\*

from tradesmithdaily:

the way the hedge funds could have done this  made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didnt  involves trickery in the options market.

the tactics involved are not a secret. in fact, the securities and exchange commission (sec) knows all about such tactics, and published a risk alert memo on the topic in august 2013.

the sec memo is titled strengthening practices for preventing and detecting illegal options trading used to reset reg sho close-out obligations. you can[read it here via the sec website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

the memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but heres a quick rundown:

* if short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* a hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock  meaning they are now short the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker)  and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* the shares bought against the call options could be synthetic longs  meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock  as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* this works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of naked shorting as part of their hedging function. this is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* as a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (a synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasnt part of the original float.) the synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* the hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have bought back their short position via buying long shares  except they actually havent! the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market makers hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

it gets very complicated, very fast. but the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like theyve covered their shorts  even if they havent truly covered, and cant, for lack of available float  by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

below is a section of the sec memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***trader a may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. by doing so, trader a appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealers close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. in practice, however, the circumstances suggest that trader a has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*******

\*\*

in short (no pun intended) these trickshelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they werent supposed to have because the shares were never properly located. which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of ftids/failed to deliver shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and michael burrys (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

these factors lend credence to the idea that shorts werent really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to cover short positions they shouldnt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. to summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.

if this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. this inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? the saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" the version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/auhukju4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. the end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though ftid/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

in addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. why? something to think about.

i would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in march ([screenshot from a wsb post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). in practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by march, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. if you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

in considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. what can retail investors do in that case? two thoughts come to mind.

**a) one recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage gme to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. if you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**b) another recourse would be to bring the matter to the sec's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

sidenote: on the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when s3 partners released it's gme short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 thursday to 113% on 1/29 friday) to 55% on 1/31 sunday, which many found to be suspicious. later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which s3 abruptly decided on sunday to make their new run_main metric of si%. many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. one consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 monday. whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

if you think of gme as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. for example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. an example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. a lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on february 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. with that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

there's an oft repeated adage on wsb that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. the ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. to explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

at least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. an analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the art of war:

* **""deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** i personally believe the press release from melvin capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""if his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. another example is the fake news/manipulation around silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

i will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. i wrote this post because i spotted some inconsistencies within the gme stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. if you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

what happened: wanda america entertainment inc, a unit of beijing-based wanda group, converted its class b common stock to class a amc shares on feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

no details of how much stock was converted were given out in the sec document.

the chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in amc for $2.5 billion in may 2012.

the theater chain along with gamestop corp. (nyse: gme), blackberry ltd (nyse: redacted), and nokia oyj (nyse: redacted) are targets of r/wallstreetbets, a reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

the short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as melvin capital and citron research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

the reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like mark cuban, dave portnoy, tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) ceo elon musk, and others.

whatever happened with gme and amc would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. trades will be settled real-time, no more t + 2. brokers like rh post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on gme they couldnt keep up.  something like that, i dont really understand. it was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. with digital securities this disappears. 

not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etfs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. you could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in california or new york or to cars like rally road does. any private company can do this, you no longer need an ipo to have investors. and they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

this democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. you no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. you dont have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

identify and invest in early players thats what i want to do. the only one i could identify and invest in is ostks tzero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. we are going to see a revolution in markets and i think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. i cant make promises because i an amateur and im not advocating that you invest in any one platform. im just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

hedge funds are a symptom - address the cause,96,lfd1sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfd1sd/hedge_funds_are_a_symptom_address_the_cause/,70,1612823742.0,"
hate hedge funds & wall street - why not end them all?

with so many users on wsb, there are many point of views about wall street and the market.  however, it seems to me the majority of the community dislikes hedge funds and the big players who have trampled over retail investors to make a living.  

considering the current economic environment, it's more imperative than ever to be ""invested"" in the stock market. the problem is the financial system and wall street ultimately benefits from the growing amount of investors.  even when retail outperforms hedge funds or manages to achieve trades like $gme, it eventually works in their benefit.  the value of assets increasing allows higher returns, speculation, and the securitization of these assets(& rehypothecation) to use for financial gain.  

the financial system has changed ever since 71s departure of the gold standard(which had problems due to bretton woods) and 1977 amendment of the federal reserve act.  ever since then you can see interest rates have trended in down for 40 years now - this is because the federal reserve's mandate of ""maximum employment"" causes fed to stop recessions with lowering interest rates which to incentivize debt/consumption.  ever since the beginning of the 80s community banks have been annihilated due to monetary policy, its structure, and congress.  wealth inequality just so happens to start it's trend upwards, favoring the 1%(really the.1%), and corporations shift board compensation from salary to stock/option compensation; corporations have also increased share buybacks and dividends as a % of profits too.  again, this is caused by monetary policy and it rewarding speculation and short term invesments over long term(capex/wages).  this structure/policy is also why private equity went on a boom in the 90s and continued ever since.  if you examine corporate bankruptcies from private equity their % is more than double the average.  pestakeholder.org has a report titled pirate equity or something along those lines and they tracked retail employment for from 2007-17 or a time frame close, and in 10 years the retail sector had added over 1 million jobs while retail owned by private equity had ""suffered"" almost 600k job losses! 

the monetary system is how the financial sector and big banks control our economy.  they have more power than congress and literally direct how capital flows and which sectors thrive or die.  the federal reserve is just an extension of wall street - the nyfed is a corporation with a board that is mostly bank ceos or members of their board.  these people are responsible for bank supervision...  

i saw a popular post on here about a guy holding his $gme position.. it was titled: ""this is for you, dad"". they were holding their position just to inflict any pain and losses possible on hedge funds.  their explanation for this was the housing crisis and how it caused his dad to lose his business and a lot more, all while these funds were bailed out and their livelihoods unaffected by a crisis they helped create.  unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't address the real culprit that caused his father's and families pain.. along with millions of americans.  

the federal reserve has created an economy for the big banks and their control - assets have literally only grown at big banks(mostly big four/six).  in fact, the office of the comptroller of the currency quarterly report will show you four banks control 155 trillion of the derivative market while all other banks control 23 trillion.  

the 800 billion bailout for banks has been mentioned as well... try 16 trillion(google gao audit) or 29 trillion(link below) if we include currency swaps(which were for other countries not the banks).  the fed created emergency facilties to specifically bailout banks and aig.  these emergency facilties were managed by... wall street.  in fact, 8 out of 10 of the highest paid contracts to manage facilities with taxpayer money to bailout themselves were given ""non-competitively"" - usually gov contracts have to provide a fair auction so they can't favor companies over another.  the fed can just say these are ""unusual and exigent circumstances"" to bypass that.  they paid blackrock over 100 million to help manage these facilties.  i think pimco was over 100 million too.  then bofa and other banks were paid tens of millions as well.  the banks literally were involved in bailing out themselves.  they received trillions in lending by the fed - citigroup had the highest total at 2.6 trillion.  they literally had their toxic debt offloaded onto the feds balance sheet.  it took the fed 10 years to unload all of their ""maiden lane"" mbs purchases.  

present day they bailed out banks in 2019 - before covid - with repo operations. 

from wallstreetonparade.com 
""if the fed had wanted the public to clearly understand that its repo loans were ongoing but had simply gone dark, it could have printed a statement to that effect on the daily page it posted showing zeros going out in repo loans. after reading the f-soc revelation, we searched the new york feds website for hours to see if it had ever made a public statement that it was going dark on the dollar amounts of its repo loans. we finally found this statement dated june 11, 2020:

beginning with this months release, the desk will no longer publish daily updates with the next business days operational details.


the fed's cumulative loans from sep 2019 to mid march 2020 totaled over 9 trillion.  half way into 2020 they stopped publishing.  however, as wsop points out from the f-soc the big banks are currently using 2.5 trillion of loans.  these are typically overnight or a few days. 

none of this is transparent because the nyfed is a corporation and is not subjected to foia - the board of fed is but i tried getting records on the emergency facilties and they stated they do not have these records because the nyfed conducts the lending and facilties.  so, the trillions of bailouts in 2008-10 and in 2019 and 2020 are literally at a corporation and not the agency(board) of government.  




alright, i could go on for another 100 pages quite literally.. let's get to the point.  

the only way to beat this system is to stop using it - practically impossible.  the only way to achieve that is to stop using dollars... also practically impossible.  however, a huge impact to the system would be to not hold any savings or any large holdings of dollars the banks.  it's imperative.  investing in anything outside of dollars, debt in dollars, and any investments is necessary - holding savings in metals is one and there are many others(dig c) could actually inflict major problems if many people actually committed to this.  if a few percent of americans did this the banks would have huge problems.  

nothing is going to change until we address the federal reserve.  anything less is just a *game that won't *stop the pillaging of avg americans from this industry.

------------- dear elon -------------,35991,lemfzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemfzi/dear_elon/,1495,1612733333.0,"gmes gone down i'm wondering why

i got out of bed at all

the morning short ladder attacks cloud up my portfolio

and i can't see at all

even if i could it would all be red

but your picture on my wall

it reminds me, that it's not so bad

it's not so bad at all

\-

dear elon, i wrote you but you still ain't buying calls

i left the dd, my eviction notice and a rocket at the bottom.  

[u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) uploaded 2 gme videos back in autumn you must not have got em

there probably was a problem with the algorithm or something

anyways, i hope you get this man, hit the hedge funds back,

just a smack, truly yours, your biggest fan

this is stan

>!\-6 days pass: also credit to u/jo9793 and u/itzlog!<

dear mister  im too good for calls or buy gme shares, this will be the  last bullcase i ever send your ass, its been six days and still no  tweet, i dont deserve it?

i know you got the last charts, the media published them perfect.

so this is my dd i'm sending you i hope you hear it i'm in a tesla right now, dare me to drive?

you  know that song by darude? forgot it's name.

about that guy who could a  saved that other guy from drowning, but didn't, then phil saw it all,  then at a a show he found him?

that's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning in debt

now it's too late, i'm down a thousand dollars now, i'm drowsy

and all i wanted was a lousy investment or a call

i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall

i love you elon, we could have been on mars together, think about it, you ruined it now.

i hope you get shorted and you dream about it, and when you dream i hope you get shorted more and you scream about it.

i hope the hedgefunds eats at you and you cant breath without gme

""buy silver, buy silver""

shut up cnbc i'm trying to talk

hey elon that's the hedge fund managers making them talk

but we didn't fuck them up yet, see i ain't like you.

cause if they buy more shorts they'll suffer more and then they'll go bankrupt too.

well gotta go they are taking my laptop and my car now

oh shit, i forgot how am i supposed to send this post ou-

\------------------

# edit: elon's reponse:

dear stan, i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy

you said your wife's pregnant by her boyfriend now, how far along is she?

look, i'm really flattered you would buy tsla calls like that

and here's an autograph for your mother

i wrote it on the tesla cap

i'm sorry i didn't see you at the annual stockholder meeting, i must have missed you

don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you

but what's this shit you said about you sold your gme when it fell too?

i say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?

you got some gambling issues stan, i think you need some counseling

to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when your stocks get down some

and what's this shit about us being ""in this together""?

i'm a billionaire lol

i really think you and your wife need each other

or maybe you just need to treat her boyfriend better

i hope you get to read this message, i just hope it reaches you in time

before you sell again, i think that you'll be doin' just fine

if you relax a little, i'm glad i inspire you but stan

why are you so mad? try to understand, that i do have diamond hands

i just don't want you to do some crazy shit

i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago so i bought gme in the dips

some dude was high on pcp and drove his car to a gamestop

and ""stonks"" he screamed, for 24 hours outside the closed shop non-stop

and in the car they found a phone with 0 gme left, but i forgot who it belonged to

come to think about, his name was, it was you

damn!  ****

the sub is divided and you're creating a cult.,2950,lettza,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lettza/the_sub_is_divided_and_youre_creating_a_cult/,705,1612755875.0,"hey guys, i've been following wsb for years now, but only recently started posting.

i'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole gme saga. there's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like ""short squeeze,"" ""counterfeit shares,"" learning what a bloomberg terminal is etc etc. listen - that's amazing. i love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.

what i worry about is that because people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. one one of the recent top posts was comparing the gme and amc charts, saying how similar they were. everyone in the comments was screaming ""mahneepulashionnnnnn."" could it have been manipulation? i mean... yes... but market **correlation** is very, very common and normal. i don't think i need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. now, i'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as i don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.

please do your research before posting this shit. this is why the vets are pissed at all the gme pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. not everyone who's done with gme is a melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. it's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. i do hold some gme and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. if you have a thesis that you believe in, you should always know the bearish case too. consider what the other side is saying too. you'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.

the other side of the story is the ogs who have also been around for years. i see why you're pissed. the sub has changed tremendously over the last month. at the same time, i want you guys to also remember that this gme thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. it's not exactly the essence of wsb to teach people (lol) but if you just leave comments saying ""you're an idiot."" or ""you should have sold like i did retard"" you're only making the problem worse.

if you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. then we can continue losing money together in peace.

tl;dr: pleas wsb again",2950,2950,0.82,False,2021-02-07 22:44:35
