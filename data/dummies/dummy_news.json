REUTERS/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo\n\nThe decision is a setback for Future, the country\u2019s second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year. It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.\n\nU.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list including Reliance.\n\nThe corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world\u2019s richest men - Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani.\n\nIt could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.\n\nAfter Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator\u2019s order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the High Court in New Delhi to enforce it.\n\nJustice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company\u2019s rights, adding that the arbitrator had \u201crightly proceeded\u201d against Future.\n\n\u201cThis court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,\u201d Midha added. \u201cAll the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.\u201d\n\nAmazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.\n\nReliance did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLEGAL BRAINS\n\nFuture\u2019s planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.\n\nJustice Midha directed a federal government counsel to relay the court\u2019s decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted \u201cin violation\u201d of the arbitrator\u2019s order, he added.\n\nBoth Future and Amazon hired some of the country\u2019s best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.\n\nFuture, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.\n\nAmazon said at some point it wanted to become a single largest shareholder of Future Retail, which it says \u201chas an irreplaceable and widespread network\u201d of outlets across India.", "pub_time": "2021-02-02 15:23:31+00:00"}, {"title": "Amazon's cloud service experiencing outage - Verge", "text": "Nov 25 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s widely used cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing a major outage that is affecting a large part of the internet, the Verge reported on Wednesday.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors; Amazon by contrast moved to recruit over 400,000 workers and earned $6.3 billion in the just-ended quarter, its second consecutive record profit.\n\nThat has kept the world\u2019s largest online retailer at the center of workplace and political tumult. Democratic politicians this month accused Amazon of holding \u201cmonopoly power\u201d over merchants on its platform, which the company disputes. Meanwhile, more than 19,000 of Amazon\u2019s U.S. employees contracted COVID-19, and some staff protested for site closures.\n\nAmazon\u2019s response now includes an estimated $4 billion in costs related to COVID-19 this holiday, up from $2.5 billion last quarter. It is testing employees for the virus and getting protective gear for new hires. It also is working less productively because of social distancing at its warehouses, which accounts for a big part of its pandemic expense, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.\n\nAmazon forecast operating profit to be between $1.0 billion and $4.5 billion, short of $5.8 billion analysts were looking for, according to research firm FactSet.\n\nCompetition this holiday remains fierce for the company in retail - and in the cloud. A traditional bright spot, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) is dueling with smaller rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for business with a big potential during the pandemic, from remote work to cloud-based gaming.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is seen at the Amazon fulfilment center in Bretigny-sur-Orge near Paris, France, October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n\nIn the just-ended third quarter, AWS sales grew 29%, while Microsoft reported a 48% rise in revenue for its Azure cloud.\n\n\u2018TIGHT ON CAPACITY\u2019\n\nStill, Amazon\u2019s sales are shaping up to hit a record level. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive and richest person in the world, said in a press release, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented holiday season.\u201d\n\nThe company reported that customers in its loyalty club Prime were shopping more often, renewing their membership at higher rates and, internationally, turning to Amazon much more for video entertainment. Merchants also expanded their budgets for advertising on Amazon in the third quarter versus a contraction during the pandemic\u2019s spring peak.\n\nThe question for some analysts has been whether Amazon\u2019s consumer division can keep up with still-growing purchases during the pandemic.\n\nThe company has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without presents on Christmas Day. Amazon now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting customers place holiday orders early.\n\nCFO Olsavsky told reporters that the company is \u201cnot totally insulated\u201d from challenges its delivery partners may be facing this quarter, though the online retailer feels ready for the holiday season.\n\n\u201cWe do think it will be tight on capacity industry-wide, and we\u2019re no exception to that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does behoove shoppers to shop early.\u201d\n\nOlsavsky said on a call with analysts that Amazon\u2019s fulfillment and logistics square footage would be 50% higher this year. He said the company already has spent heavily on expanding its transport capability, part of some $30 billion in capital expenditures and leases through the third quarter. The heightened transportation investment will likely continue over years to come, he said.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales of $112 billion to $121 billion. That would mark the company\u2019s first over $100 billion and follows a third-quarter revenue beat that analysts such as eMarketer\u2019s Andrew Lipsman did not expect.\n\n\u201cWhile it was clear that the pandemic-driven shift to e-commerce would keep Amazon\u2019s topline elevated, it surprised by easily surpassing an already high bar,\u201d Lipsman said.", "pub_time": "2020-10-29 20:11:45+00:00"}, {"title": "Big Tech's market dominance spurs numerous U.S. antitrust probes", "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Tuesday in what could be just the first in a series of legal salvos against high-profile tech companies.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo from Reuters files./File Photo\n\nIt has been known for more than a year that Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc also face an array of antitrust probes on both the federal and state levels.\n\nWhile Democrats may be viewed as tougher on antitrust regulation, traditional Republican concerns about regulatory overreach appear to be outweighed by anger on the political right over claims that Big Tech tries to stifle conservative voices.\n\nThe following are other inquiries now under way.\n\nJustice Department on Apple: This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple\u2019s app store.

The announcement on Tuesday settles a long-running question about who would replace the world\u2019s second-richest person at the company\u2019s helm.\n\nBezos is ending his role as CEO on a high note: the business he began as an internet bookseller 27 years ago is now one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies and posted three consecutive record profits after losses in decades prior. On Tuesday, Amazon reported quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time.\n\nJassy, 53, joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding AWS and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions of customers, the company\u2019s website said. He had been a clear contender for the top job since Amazon created two CEO roles reporting to Bezos years ago, the other held by recently retired consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.\n\nTom Johnson, chief transformation officer at global marketing firm Mindshare, said Jassy\u2019s promotion underscored the centrality of the web hosting business to Amazon\u2019s strategy.\n\n\u201cJassy\u2019s background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon\u2019s business strategy. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth,\u201d he said.\n\nJassy is known for understanding highly technical details and has regularly taken jabs at legacy player Oracle Corp and cloud rival Microsoft Corp, which AWS continues to exceed in sales. Bezos has made fewer public remarks about competitors.\n\nUnder Jassy\u2019s leadership, Amazon\u2019s cloud business has signed major customers including Verizon, McDonald\u2019s and Honeywell. Silicon Valley startups have long relied on AWS, and the division\u2019s annual revenue grew 37% in 2019 and 30% in 2020, helping cement its position as the market leader.\n\nOne contract AWS failed to win was the $10 billion \u201cJEDI\u201d project from the Pentagon, which was awarded to Microsoft.\n\nJassy has aimed to bestow a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS\u2019s annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.\n\nBezos, who already has focused on other personal enterprises in years past, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon\u2019s website, \u201cAs Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions.\u201d Blue Origin is Bezos\u2019 space company.\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ve never had more energy, and this isn\u2019t about retiring.\u201d\n\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Bezos would work on \u201clarge one-way door issues,\u201d such as acquisitions and other strategies where there is a high cost to reversing course.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nCOVID SPENDING DOWN\n\nAmazon\u2019s net sales rose to $125.6 billion as consumers turned to the world\u2019s largest online retailer for their holiday shopping, beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAmazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nJassy\u2019s AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division recently announced deals with ViacomCBS, the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.\n\nAmazon said it was not naming an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.\n\nMeanwhile Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies.

The founder and chief executive of Amazon.com is handing over the CEO role to Andy Jassy, head of the cloud division AWS, after a fortuitously good year at the $1.7 trillion retail giant. The new boss will face a different, more challenging normal that includes regulatory scrutiny.\n\nFirst the results: Amazon said Tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue rose 44% year-over-year to $126 billion. That\u2019s the first time the company topped $100 billion of sales in a quarter helped by delivering items to customer\u2019s doorsteps during the pandemic and, of course, the holidays.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The rest harkens some major challenges for Jassy. Operating expenses ballooned 42% in part because costs associated with worldwide shipping rose about two-thirds. The vaccine rollout will coincide with choice, which could make life harder for Amazon. The company is forecasting sales volume to drop by a quarter in this period compared to three months ending December.\n\nThe hurdles may partly be why Jassy is now leading the company. AWS is one of Amazon\u2019s jewels. Growth slowed a tad in the fourth quarter to 28%, but the division has much higher margins than Amazon\u2019s other units, booking more than half of its operating profit despite accounting for just 12% of total sales.\n\nAnd yet Amazon\u2019s success is precisely what will make Washington continue its pursuit of the retail giant. On the same day as earnings, Amazon agreed to pay more than $60 million to the Federal Trade Commission to settle charges it withheld some tips from drivers.\n\nTime away from the corner office will give Bezos the opportunity to focus on his other projects including the Bezos Earth Fund and the Washington Post. He will likely continue to have a guiding hand, too, and perhaps will find himself in the Beltway hot seat. Still, the company\u2019s forward enterprise value-to-sales figure is hovering near its high, hit earlier this year.

It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route.\n\nBut post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs.

Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.\n\nDanish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were \u201cpretty much full\u201d. Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of \u201cland bridge\u201d traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blown away by the demand,\u201d Coffey said.\n\nNo one knows if the shift is permanent.\n\nThe Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes.\n\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\n\nEddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland\u2019s transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.\n\nFerry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena\u2019s operations chief in Cherbourg.

Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth.\n\nNow its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.\n\nCarr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.\n\n\u201cI was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, \u2018Glenn, are you putting on more services?\u2019\u201d\n\nAn 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port\u2019s Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.\n\n\u201cBrexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,\u201d he said.", "pub_time": "2021-01-22 13:30:35+00:00"}, {"title": "U.S. senators ask Amazon if it tracks employees, curbs bids to form unions", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen at an Amazon facility in Bethpage on Long Island in New York, U.S., March 17, 2020.

The company has not faced a union election in the United States since 2014, and a \u201cyes\u201d vote would be the first ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.\n\nAmazon, America\u2019s second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, has told workers it already offers the pay and benefits unions promise, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. Its operation in France offers a picture of what the company would avoid: strong unions there precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses this year.\n\nThe upcoming vote is for associates in Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama; they will weigh whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The organizing committee has launched a social media campaign, shared union authorization cards and collected enough to hold the election.\n\nThis week and last, the RWDSU and Amazon negotiated the election terms. By Tuesday they agreed to have seasonal workers in the bargaining unit, as well as process assistants, whose inclusion the union had questioned for their supervisory authority, according to the election hearings presided by a government labor board. That board will set the election date.\n\nThe larger the bargaining unit\u2019s size - now expected to be over 5,700 - the more votes the union needs to win.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon said, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this group represents the majority of our employees\u2019 views.

Amazon.com Inc\u2019s announcement this week that it would be rolling out AI-powered cameras in its branded delivery vans for safety has drawn criticism from privacy advocates and workers concerned with being subjected to surveillance on the job.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest e-commerce firm said the cameras, which are developed by transportation technology company Netradyne, would improve safety of both drivers and the communities in which they deliver.\n\nBut employees like Henry Search, a 22-year-old delivery driver in Washington state, said they saw cameras capturing their work day as an \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are out here working all day, trying our best already,\u201d Search told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. \u201cThe cameras are just another way to control us.\u201d\n\nPrivacy advocates warned that equipping Amazon\u2019s fleet of about 30,000 delivery vehicles with AI cameras could set a dangerous precedent for privacy.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the largest expansion of corporate surveillance in human history,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of tech nonprofit Fight for the Future. \u201cIf this becomes the norm, we are talking about the extinction of human privacy.\u201d\n\nAmazon has come under scrutiny in the past for accidents involving delivery drivers.\n\nA company spokeswoman said in emailed comments that \u201cthis technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.\u201d\n\nIn an instructional video about the cameras, Amazon\u2019s senior manager for last-mile safety Karolina Haraldsdottir said cameras will record 100% of the time, but are not set up to livestream from inside of vans.\n\nThey will detect unsafe driving, including when drivers appear distracted or drowsy, she explained, adding that the footage could be used by the company\u2019s safety team, or in investigations of theft or accidents.\n\nBut Greer said that safety issues could be addressed by slowing the pace of work. \u201cThe first thing they (Amazon) should do to improve safety would be not have such outrageous delivery quotas that force people into unsafe conditions,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother driver in Massachusetts, who asked not to use his name to protect his identity, said he would welcome a camera displayed outside his van to record evidence for any accident.\n\n\u201cBut a camera on my face all the time, I don\u2019t see how that keeps me safe - it\u2019s too much,\u201d he said in a phone interview, noting that drivers already use an app called Mentor that tracks the location and movements of the vehicle.\n\nDATA USE\n\nHaraldsdottir said that \u201conly a limited set of authorized people\u201d would have access to driver footage from the cameras.\n\nBut some drivers worried Amazon might sell or share the footage with third parties, or use the cameras to monitor their performance on the job.\n\n\u201cThe footage recorded could be shared with a future possible employer who can then decide to reject you before even knowing you,\u201d said one driver from Michigan who asked not to give his full name.\n\nAlthough he enjoys doing deliveries for Amazon, he said he is currently looking for other work because he does not want to be subjected to surveillance.\n\nRights activists say Amazon already has an extensive surveillance system in its warehouses to track workers\u2019 movements and boost productivity, including navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras and recorded footage.\n\n\u201cThere are no laws in place to meaningfully limit what Amazon can do with the footage they collect,\u201d said Greer, noting that other surveillance products, such as the Ring doorbell camera system, can share footage with police departments.\n\n\u2018DYSTOPIA PRIME\u2019\n\nSurveillance experts say that the privacy implications of Amazon\u2019s camera network for delivery vans extend far beyond drivers.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, a professor of law at D.C.\u2019s American University, said Amazon\u2019s private surveillance networks would further entrench the snooping powers of government.\n\n\u201cWhile the inclination to use AI technology to enhance driver safety is commendable, the failure to think about the privacy and surveillance issues and equities is troubling,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile police may not have direct access to the footage, authorities will be able to access it in the course of an investigation, expanding the reach of police surveillance, Ferguson explained.\n\nLast June, Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software, following criticism that the technology reinforced racial bias.\n\n\u201cAmazon is quite literally building mobile surveillance vans to film our neighborhoods, something that we would be rightly horrified about if our government did it,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to join dystopia prime.\u201d", "pub_time": "2021-02-05 14:24:37+00:00"}, {"title": "Shell, Mitsubishi unit Eneco to supply wind power to Amazon's European facilities", "text": "Slideshow ( 2 images )\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) -

Parler alleged in its lawsuit the next day and in an accompanying motion for a temporary restraining order that Amazon, driven by \u201cpolitical animus\u201d and a desire to boost Parler\u2019s competitor Twitter, had sabotaged Parler at precisely the moment that Parler was poised for explosive growth. Parler counsel David Groesbeck accused Amazon of violating federal antitrust law in addition to breach of contract, arguing that Amazon\u2019s actions illegally favored Twitter.\n\nAmazon\u2019s lawyers at Davis Wright Tremaine filed the company\u2019s brief opposing the TRO Tuesday night. Citing scores of chilling posts by Parler users - including vivid threats of violence to politicians, social media executives, journalists, Amazon delivery drivers, even teachers \u2013 Amazon argued that it was Parler, not Amazon, that had breached their agreement. Amazon\u2019s terms of service, the brief said, prohibit content that \u201cviolates the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others.\u201d If its web services customers violate those terms, Amazon said, it has the right to suspend or terminate their accounts immediately. And, according to Amazon, it gave Parler plenty of opportunity to come up with protocols to comply with Amazon rules, as an Amazon executive recounted in a redacted declaration. (Amazon said it had redacted the name of the executive for fear its employee would be attacked.) Parler\u2019s response \u2013 an inchoate plan to use volunteers to identify dangerous posts \u2013 was inadequate, Amazon said.\n\nAmazon also pointed to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the clause conservatives love to hate. Section 230, as you know, restricts liability for online service providers. In this case, Amazon said, it precludes Parler\u2019s claims because Amazon acted in good faith. Under Section 230, Amazon said, it can\u2019t be liable for acting in good faith to block violent and harassing content.\n\nBut for me, Amazon\u2019s most interesting argument refuted Parler\u2019s allegation that Amazon violated the Sherman Act by favoring Twitter, even though, according to Parler, Twitter\u2019s content can be just as violent and abusive as posts on Parler. The pleading standard for federal antitrust claims, as Amazon\u2019s Davis Wright lawyers said in their brief, is notoriously strict after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 ruling in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly (550 U.S. 544). Antitrust plaintiffs must plausibly allege an anticompetitive conspiracy. But Parler didn\u2019t even allege that Amazon and Twitter ever discussed Parler, let alone that they had an agreement to squelch the right-leaning site.\n\nAmazon provided a declaration (also redacted) from an executive who negotiated the company\u2019s recently announced agreement with Twitter. Amazon had previously been providing web hosting services for ancillary Twitter services, like data backup and Twitter\u2019s new Fleets feature, but not for Twitter\u2019s main feed. Under the new agreement, announced in December, Amazon will begin hosting Twitter\u2019s main feed at an unspecified future date. But according to the executive, the negotiations with Twitter did not touch upon Parler.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, (Amazon) and Twitter have never discussed, much less agreed upon, any policy, practice, or act directed at Parler,\u201d the executive said. \u201cTo the contrary, we have an internal policy never to discuss matters involving one customer with another customer. Nobody in my organization would be authorized to discuss Parler with Twitter without my authorization (and) I have not authorized any AWS employee to discuss Parler with Twitter.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a very good reason, according to Amazon, why Amazon would not have conspired with Twitter to thwart Parler: Amazon has no motive to pick between them. It\u2019s in the business of providing web services to any customer, regardless of political views, that\u2019s willing to comply with its terms, its executive said in the redacted declaration.\n\n\u201cAWS has no incentive to stop doing business with paying customers,\u201d Davis Wright wrote in Amazon\u2019s brief. It only suspended Parler\u2019s account, the brief said, because Parler violated Amazon\u2019s terms by failing to offer a systemic plan to take down violent and abusive posts.\n\nStanford law professor Mark Lemley told my Reuters colleague Tom Rowe that Parler\u2019s antitrust theory just doesn\u2019t seem plausible. \u201cIt would be one thing if there were evidence that Amazon, Twitter and Facebook conspired together to target Parler,\u201d Lemley said. \u201cBut Amazon acting alone isn\u2019t an antitrust problem \u2026 Amazon has a general right to refuse to deal with anyone for any reason, or indeed no reason at all.\u201d\n\nParler\u2019s reply brief, filed Wednesday afternoon, argued that circumstantial evidence backs its claim that Amazon acted in the interest of Twitter, a much bigger and wealthier client than Parler. Amazon only began threatening to shut down Parler web services when users began switching en masse from Twitter to Parler, the brief said. That timing, coupled with Amazon\u2019s tolerance for violent posts by Twitter users, suggests a conspiracy to promote Twitter at Parler\u2019s expense.\n\nParler also said Amazon and Twitter had \u201ca clear interest in\n\neliminating an up-and-coming service like Parler,\u201d although the brief did not directly respond to Amazon\u2019s argument that it\u2019s happy to take money from any customer that complies with its terms. Parler said Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct by erasing its site from the microblogging market.\n\nU.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein will preside over a hearing on Parler\u2019s TRO motion tomorrow.\n\nParler and its users are convinced there\u2019s a double standard. As the company complained in its filings, Twitter users also post violent threats: Just the day before Amazon suspended Parler, #HangMikePence was a trending topic on Twitter. (Amazon\u2019s brief explained that it does not currently provide web hosting services to Twitter\u2019s main feed, so it could not have threatened suspension.

It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.\n\nAmazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.\n\nNow, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said.

The Amazon boss is locked in an ugly fight to stop a troubled big-box retailer from selling itself to his biggest rival, Mukesh Ambani\u2019s $166 billion Reliance Industries. Any victory by the U.S. e-commerce giant could wind up costing thousands of jobs and spark a nasty political backlash, but the standoff also might deliver longer-term rewards.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Kishore Biyani, CEO and founder of India's Future Group poses after the inauguration of Foodhall, a premium lifestyle food superstore by the Future Group, store in Mumbai, India, December 1, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo\n\nAmbani will turbocharge his retail business if he successfully acquires Kishore Biyani\u2019s sprawling Future empire. The $3.4 billion deal announced in August includes more than 17 companies. In addition to its huge oil and telecom operations, Reliance is India\u2019s top brick-and-mortar retailer, with some 12,000 stores. Swallowing Future Retail, its closest competitor, would bag another 1,500. India\u2019s Competition Commission already has cleared the deal.\n\nThe takeover would trample over part of Amazon\u2019s expansion strategy in online groceries. It has a partnership with Future Retail, including its Big Bazaar hypermarkets. The $1.6 trillion company snapped up upscale U.S. supermarket chain Whole Foods back in 2017 in its biggest acquisition. In India, however, where Amazon already has invested some $6.5 billion over the past decade, it lacks its own physical shops. Even Walmart\u2019s Indian online marketplace, Flipkart, has the benefit of the Best Price cash-and-carry stores operated by its parent company.\n\nIn its push to stop the sale to Reliance, Amazon has been accused of acting like the East India Company, a 17th century London start-up whose employees killed, pillaged and bribed as they conquered the subcontinent. Counsel for Biyani\u2019s Future group have trotted out the provocative comparison to complain that a foreign company is using a dubious minority investment to decide the fate of a struggling Indian outfit.\n\nCOUPON CLIPPING\n\nAmazon\u2019s involvement is contentious. Bezos took a circuitous route to sink his claws into Future Retail after debt issues prompted Biyani to consider selling. India does not welcome foreign direct investment into physical retailers that sell multiple brands. Indian politicians consider mom-and-pop store owners as an important constituency. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is easing investment restrictions across multiple sectors and Bezos reasonably took a punt that rules governing retail might change too.\n\nOn that basis, Amazon spent about $200 million in August 2019 to pick up a 49% stake in Future Coupons, a wholesaling part of the group. As part of the deal, Biyani and his related entities agreed to restrictions on transferring shares. According to Amazon, that included to Reliance. At the time, Biyani\u2019s group, along with Future Coupons, controlled Future Retail through stock and warrants. Days earlier, Future Coupons inked a separate agreement giving it the right to veto any transfer of assets by Future Retail, effectively locking up the shopping assets.\n\nAlmost exactly a year later, as Biyani\u2019s debt problems ballooned, Amazon was shoved aside. Reliance swooped in and agreed to its own complex, multistage deal to buy Future\u2019s retail, wholesale and supply chain businesses. If that transaction closes, Amazon and other investors in Future companies will end up owning shares in a rump that holds a hodgepodge of assets including an insurance joint venture with Generali.\n\nIndia\u2019s foreign investment rules mean Amazon is precluded from offering an alternative deal to Reliance\u2019s to stop Future Retail from going into liquidation, which could save some 29,000 jobs. Amazon had lined up friendly domestic backers to try and help before the Reliance deal was struck. They were interested in the retail operations, but not much of the rest. Either way, any such investors are unlikely to be interested in going up against India\u2019s richest man.\n\nBezos is not intimidated, however. He\u2019s fighting to uphold Amazon\u2019s original agreement, in part to make clear that he won\u2019t be pushed around. The company in October won an emergency hold on the transaction through an arbitration in Singapore, and lawyers for both sides are now arguing in a Delhi court about whether that ruling applies in India. The outcome is key to Future group\u2019s fate and the dispute could go all the way to the country\u2019s top court.\n\nPRECEDENTS SET\n\nAmazon is testing the enforceability of contracts in the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, a measure of the ease of doing business. It\u2019s also a fresh test to see if local courts uphold foreign arbitration awards; overseas companies with Indian partners typically look to London or Singapore tribunals. Japanese telecom operator NTT Docomo and pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo both won overseas arbitrations against commercial partners and those rulings were upheld in India.\n\nPoliticians reeling from the pandemic won\u2019t be pleased if Amazon\u2019s aggressive move results in job losses. A local media report last week suggested an official investigative agency is probing the company\u2019s Future deal for potential violations of foreign investment rules. But India is better off with Amazon than without it. The company operates 60 massive fulfilment centres and is creating jobs, developing logistics and supporting exports by small- and medium-sized Indian businesses.\n\nThe entire mess might have been avoided had India set a stronger example for tycoons to follow. Even now it is unclear if the government will honour two recent arbitration rulings it lost over tax disputes with British companies. Cairn Energy has written to New Delhi threatening to seize Indian assets overseas if it fails to pay the $1.4 billion awarded in its favour. Unlike Vodafone, which also won its case, the oil and gas explorer can afford to play hardball because it is no longer invested in the country.\n\nFuture\u2019s retail assets are a prize, but not necessarily a must-have in a fragmented retail market. The bigger message is Amazon\u2019s willingness to fight against powerful rivals.

But the talks to invest in the Chinese-owned TikTok remain shrouded in political uncertainty.\n\nThat, however, has not stopped Walmart from moving ahead with its strategy, the advertising agencies and brands said.\n\nYet it\u2019s early days in the drive for Walmart, which has historically struggled to create new lines of business and has never turned a profit form its e-commerce business. Some advertisers and ad agencies said the retailer still had a distance to go on the technology front, including tracking how ads translated into sales - a key selling point for brands.\n\nWalmart faces a huge task chasing Amazon, which is expected to generate about $13 billion in ads this year according to eMarketer, while it is also battling smaller rivals including Target and Kroger which are building their own ad platforms.\n\nAnother challenge it must overcome: Walmart disclosed this month that Stefanie Jay, leader of Walmart Media Group, will leave the company for a \u201cnew opportunity.\u201d Rich Lehrfeld, Walmart\u2019s former interim chief marketing officer, will now lead Walmart Media Group.\n\n\u2018ALWAYS IN, ALWAYS ON\u2019\n\nIn meetings with brands and advertising technology partners, Walmart\u2019s executives have summed up its goals with a tagline - \u201cAlways In, Always On\u201d - a reference to how its store network will help advertisers reach more customers, Walmart told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s online or in the shopping aisle on a screen in the grocery section, they want that brand message through the whole ecosystem,\u201d said Nich Weinheimer, general manager of e-commerce at ad tech firm Kenshoo, which works with Walmart.\n\nWalmart has used its data to improve targeting of ads and convinced some advertisers to sign long-term advertising contracts, brands and former employees say. The company told Reuters that its deals, which include store and digital ads, are typically worth low double-digit millions of dollars.\n\nDan Cooke, head of e-commerce at jam-maker JM Smucker Co which places ads with Walmart, told Reuters that the retailer had gathered better data on consumers and their purchases this year.\n\nWalmart has uses the data to improve its online display advertising, give clients a better idea of how their ads are performing and provide \u201ccritical\u201d online tools that makes it easier for them to monitor and control campaigns themselves, he added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an arms race that\u2019s going on - Amazon has certainly been a trailblazer,\u201d said Cooke, adding that Walmart was responding \u201cvery aggressively.\u201d\n\nKNOWING WHAT SELLS\n\nWalmart executives view the advertising drive as significant to the success of the retailer\u2019s e-commerce business as a whole, according to the source briefed on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nNearly 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart, according to the retailer\u2019s website. This is a strength that Walmart needs to leverage more, according to the ad agencies and brands, as it has an insight into consumers\u2019 shopping habits.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stores and Walmart.com together count about 160 million visitors a week, data from investment bank Cowen shows.\n\nWalmart\u2019s advertising strategy has nonetheless been somewhat hit or miss over the decades.\n\nThe retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, dabbled with the advertising business in the late 1990s and early 2000s with an in-store TV network that aired commercials. It expanded the business about 15 years ago to include its website through Triad Retail Media.\n\nThe retailer cut ties with Triad in February 2019 and brought all ad operations in-house under Walmart Media Group.\n\n\u2018GLITCHES\u2019 COMPLAINTS\n\nThe company still faces a series of challenges.\n\nIt needs to improve ad-measuring capabilities to show exactly how certain ads lead to specific sales, Smucker\u2019s Cooke said.\n\nSome advertisers have also complained about \u201cglitches\u201d where ads occasionally disappear from Walmart.com or don\u2019t show up at all. Kimberly Williams, a former campaign manager at Walmart Media Group, said this happened \u201call the time\u201d, recalling an ad for Mars Inc\u2019s M&M candies that disappeared for several hours.\n\nAccording to brands, this happens from time to time on other retailers\u2019 platforms as well. Walmart declined to comment.\n\nLonger term, the challenge for Walmart is to figure out an overarching media content strategy to keep customers engaged for longer periods, according to the industry players interviewed.\n\nWalmart considered launching a subscription video service in 2018 but decided against it, according to sources. In other forays, it invested $250 million in a joint venture to develop interactive content and struck a deal with \u201cJames Bond\u201d studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for the Vudu video-on-demand service, which it sold last April.\n\nWalmart is also going after a new channel of ad revenue called \u201cbrand advertising,\u201d typically reserved for TV, by offering more formats like online display ads, said George Manas, chief media officer at ad agency OMD USA.\n\nExecutives hope successful advertising relationships could help it secure promotional tie-ins with the Walmart+ subscription service, its version of Amazon Prime.\n\nLosing the TikTok deal won\u2019t be a disaster, but landing it would help Walmart flesh out a competitive media strategy, said Mark Boidman, managing director and head of media and tech services at PJ Solomon, which advises Walmart.\n\n\u201cAmazon surrounds the consumer in a 360-degree manner,\u201d Boidman said, referring to Amazon Prime and the free video-streaming service that comes with it.\n\nWalmart is still \u201cgetting there.\u201d\n\n(This story adds dropped word \u201cformer\u201d in paragraph 13)", "pub_time": "2020-10-20 10:05:04+00:00"}, {"title": "India retail king Biyani sees quick OK of Future's $3.4 billion deal despite Amazon dispute", "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India\u2019s Future Group expects swift regulatory approval of its $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets, its chief executive said, even as its warring business partner Amazon.com Inc intensifies efforts to block the deal.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Kishore Biyani, CEO and founder of India's Future Group poses after the inauguration of Foodhall, a premium lifestyle food superstore by the Future Group, store in Mumbai, India, December 1, 2018.

Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.\n\nBestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.\n\nEstee Lauder Companies Inc this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.\n\nAmericans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research.\n\nAdobe Inc\u2019s e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship 67% more holiday gifts than a year ago and to 18% more recipients as travel gets curbed.\n\nBut Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.\n\nAmazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon\u2019s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1/2 times the rate over the same period last year.\n\nIt pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon\u2019s largest ever.\n\nThe company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts for some items.\n\nMYSTERIOUS SENDER\n\nBut some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.\n\n\u201cThe gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,\u201d said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.\n\nAmazon said its gift features remain popular.\n\nJeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.\n\nThough Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he \u201clearned his lesson.\u201d (Reporting by Paresh Dave; Additional reporting by Melissa Fares in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "pub_time": "2020-11-20 12:01:35+00:00"}, {"title": "Amazon buys 11 aircraft to expand air cargo fleet", "text": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it bought 11 Boeing 767-300 aircraft, as it looks to quicken delivery with an expanded fleet.\n\nThe aircraft, including seven from Delta Air Lines and four from WestJet Airlines, will join Amazon's air cargo network by 2022, the online retailer said in a statement here.
